        "article": "El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, se convirtió el miércoles 13 en el primer presidente en pasar por el proceso de destitución dos veces, ya que 222 demócratas y 10 republicanos en la Cámara votaron para encausarlo por su incitación a los disturbios en el Capitolio. Entre ellos se encontraba la representante Liz Cheney (Wyoming), la republicana de tercer rango en el caucus republicano de la Cámara de Representantes, quien, siguiendo su conciencia, se expuso valientemente a severas críticas de aquellos en su partido que están a favor de Trump.Support our journalism.

Otros que buscan evitar el proceso de destitución están considerando censurar o tratar de obligar a Trump a renunciar. Después de cuatro años de indignación y humillación, al menos algunos líderes republicanos clave están rompiendo con el peor presidente de la historia moderna de Estados Unidos.No hay duda de que Trump merecía ser impugnado. Como explicó Cheney: “El presidente de Estados Unidos convocó a esta turba, reunió a la turba y encendió la llama de este ataque. Todo lo que siguió fue obra suya. Nada de esto hubiera sucedido sin el presidente. El presidente podría haber intervenido inmediata y enérgicamente para detener la violencia. No lo hizo\".Read in English: President Trump deserved impeachment. The Senate must convict him quickly.El proceso de destitución no significa que no existe la necesidad de una mayor investigación. Quedan grandes preguntas: ¿Qué tan cerca estuvo la turba de dañar a los miembros del Congreso o al vicepresidente? ¿Hubo una conspiración? ¿Participaron otros líderes republicanos? ¿Cuál fue la fuente de las bombas caseras descubiertas el 6 de enero? ¿Por qué el Capitolio estaba tan expuesto y el respaldo aparentemente no estaba disponible? ¿Qué medidas se deben tomar para que esto nunca vuelva a suceder?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAun así, aunque “se aclarará mucho más en los próximos días y semanas”, señaló Cheney, “lo que sabemos ahora es suficiente”. La escala conocida de la transgresión de Trump ya lo califica para un castigo severo, y el peligro que representa para la vida cívica estadounidense es demasiado importante para ignorarlo. El poder del proceso de destitución debe ser lo suficientemente ágil como para abordar una situación como Watergate, donde hubo tiempo para realizar una investigación profunda para determinar la culpabilidad del presidente, y la redada del Capitolio, en la que la culpabilidad obvia del presidente y el riesgo continuo que representa, justifican la destitución sumaria.Escucha el pódcast El Washington Post para conocer las últimas noticias en españolEs por eso que esperamos que McConnell reconsidere su reportada renuencia a avanzar rápidamente hacia un juicio. En cualquier caso, el mandato del presidente termina el próximo miércoles 20, pero destituirlo primero enviaría un mensaje importante. También sería incuestionablemente legítimo, considerando que algunos académicos creen que el Senado no tiene el derecho constitucional de juzgar, condenar y excluir del cargo futuro a un presidente después de que termine su mandato. Un juicio prolongado o tardado en el Senado podría eclipsar los días de apertura del presidente electo Joe Biden, retrasando la confirmación de sus nombramientos —con el consiguiente riesgo para la seguridad nacional— y descarrilando su agenda legislativa.Si McConnell se niega a convocar al Senado esta semana, los senadores deben actuar con rapidez una vez que se hayan reunido y dividir su tiempo entre juzgar a Trump y permitir el lanzamiento de la administración de Biden. Pero la nación estaría mejor servida con un juicio rápido que terminara con el veredicto de culpabilidad que se merece Trump.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLeer más:Hillary Clinton: Trump debe ser impugnado.

        "article": "It may be too little too late, but in the end a few brave Republicans found their voices and spoke up to protect American democracy from President Trump’s depredations.Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the House and scion of a revered Republican family, changed the debate overnight when she said she would vote to impeach the man who “lit the flame” of last week’s deadly attack on Congress. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” she said.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightLesser-known but no less brave was Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), who at 1:42 p.m. Wednesday stood on the floor and announced: “There is no excuse for President Trump’s actions. . . . With a heavy heart and clear resolve, I will vote yes on these articles of impeachment.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLess than five minutes later, another Republican from Washington, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, rose to declare that she, too, would vote to impeach. “I’m not afraid of losing my job, but I am afraid that my country will fail,” she said.In the Oval Office, Trump must have feared a stampede. Within minutes, the White House issued a statement from the president: “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence.” Trump’s chief defender, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), quickly read it aloud in the chamber.If only Republicans had spoken up earlier. If only, even now, more Republicans could overcome their fear of Trump and denounce him for inciting insurrection, they could rid the party of this cancer.Story continues below advertisementAfter greenlighting his every assault on democratic norms, many Republicans amplified his attempts to overturn the election results by perpetuating the lie that the election was stolen. It culminated in last week’s bloodshed and mayhem in the Capitol.AdvertisementNow, our nation’s capital is under siege by the MAGA mob.  Approximately 2,000 National Guard troops bivouacked in the halls of Congress before Wednesday’s impeachment debate, the first such deployment since the Civil War and part of a force of 20,000 coming to defend the capital from attack by pro-Trump rioters.Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) kicked off the impeachment debate for Republicans by asking “for God’s blessing and protection . . . for all who come to this chamber.” He had to cut debate short because speakers were delayed navigating through the fortress. “They’re just having a hard time getting here,” he said.Story continues below advertisementRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a veteran, observed that “there are more troops right now in Washington, D.C., than in Afghanistan, and they are here to defend us against . . . the president of the United States and his mob.” He urged Republicans to see the warriors defending democracy and “take a tough vote.”AdvertisementIn the end, 10 honorable House Republicans took that tough vote — even though it could cost them their jobs, and even though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) let it be known, in the middle of the House debate, that he would block a Senate trial until at least Jan. 19 — the day before Trump leaves office.One after the other, several of the 139 House Republicans who last week voted to overturn the election results now justified votes against impeachment because “our country needs unity” (Rep. Debbie Lesko, Ariz.) and “our nation is still healing” (Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, Pa.). Several of those who last week engaged in a seditious act now cited Lincoln’s second inaugural call to “bind up the nation’s wounds.”Story continues below advertisement“Unity, after they voted to overturn a free and fair election?” replied Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). He said the Capitol attack “would never have happened if everybody stood up in unity and called out the president when he was not telling the American people the truth.”AdvertisementSome always-Trump Republicans defended Trump’s words inciting the Capitol insurrection, employing a web of false equivalence, whataboutism and warnings that impeachment “will cause further unrest,” as Ronny L. Jackson (R-Tex.), Trump-doctor-turned-congressman, put it. Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) denounced the “unconstitutional” election. QAnon-admiring Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) declared: “I call bullcrap!” Jordan pushed an effort to strip Cheney of her leadership position.But most Republicans were conspicuously unwilling to defend Trump. “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Trump should “accept his share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest,” McCarthy added, and a “censure resolution would be prudent.”Story continues below advertisementCole called Trump’s words “inappropriate and reckless.” Freshman Rep. Nancy Mace (S.C.) said “I hold him accountable . . . for the attack on our Capitol.” Rep. Tom McClintock (Calif.) said Trump “was wrong.” Rep. Jodey Arrington (Tex.) said Trump used “poor judgment.”AdvertisementYa think? Lawmakers described the mob violence they witnessed personally: “I was in this chamber when those gunshots rang.” . . . “Democrats and Republicans hid on the floor, put on gas masks.” . . . “I heard the mob pounding on the door.” . . . “Fearing for my life.”After such personal terror at Trump’s hands, it’s disturbing that only 10 Republicans found the courage to break with him.

        "article": "PRESIDENT TRUMP became on Wednesday the first president to be impeached twice, as 222 Democrats and 10 Republicans in the House voted to indict him for his incitement of the Capitol riot. Among them was Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican in the House GOP caucus, who, in following her conscience, bravely exposed herself to severe criticism from the pro-Trump elements of her party.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightReports indicate some Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), are considering voting to convict Mr. Trump in a future Senate trial. Others who shy from impeachment are considering censure or trying to force Mr. Trump to resign. After four years of outrage and humiliation, at least some key GOP leaders are breaking with the worst president in modern U.S. history.There is no doubt Mr. Trump deserved to be impeached. As Ms. Cheney explained, “The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not.”Leer en español: Trump merecía ser impugnado. El Senado debe condenarlo rápidamente.Impeaching Mr. Trump now does not obviate the need for further investigation. Large questions remain: How close did the mob come to harming members of Congress or the vice president? Was there a conspiracy? Were other GOP leaders involved? What was the source of the pipe bombs discovered on Jan. 6? Why was the Capitol so exposed and backup seemingly so unavailable? What measures must be taken to ensure this never happens again?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementEven so, though “much more will become clear in coming days and weeks,” Ms. Cheney noted, “what we know now is enough.” The known scale of Mr. Trump’s offense already qualifies him for severe punishment, and the danger he poses to American civic life is too substantial to ignore. The impeachment power must be nimble enough to address a situation like Watergate, where there was time to conduct a deep investigation to ascertain the president’s guilt, and the Capitol raid, in which the president’s obvious culpability and the continuing risk he poses warrant summary removal.That is why we hope Mr. McConnell reconsiders his reported reluctance to move swiftly toward a trial. The president’s term ends in any case next Wednesday, but removal first would send an important message. It also would be unquestionably legitimate, whereas some scholars believe the Senate does not have the constitutional right to try, convict and bar from future office a president after his term ends. A delayed or a lengthy Senate trial could overshadow President-elect Joe Biden’s opening days, slowing confirmation of his appointees — with attendant risk to national and homeland security — and derailing his legislative agenda.If Mr. McConnell refuses to convene the Senate this week, senators must move with dispatch once they have convened, and split their time between trying Mr. Trump and enabling the launch of the Biden administration. But the nation would be better served by a prompt trial ending in the guilty verdict Mr. Trump deserves.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRead more:Henry Olsen: Republicans should impeach President TrumpJennifer Rubin: Impeachment is just the start.

        "article": "The second impeachment of President Trump was, like the first, largely partisan. Democrats voted to impeach; Republicans opposed it. But that doesn’t fully convey the shift between the impeachment that occurred in 2019 and the one that occurred on Wednesday. That 10 Republicans sided with a unanimous Democratic majority marks a repudiation of historic significance.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightSure, we’re talking about a small sample size here. In U.S. presidential history, there have been only four impeachment efforts, two of which targeted Trump. So describing something as the most bipartisan of four is not incorrect, but it should be considered in the context that this doesn’t happen very often. Or, at least, that it didn’t used to.Nonetheless, that there has been a consistent pattern of a president’s party sticking with him in an impeachment effort makes the defections seen Wednesday stand out. Particularly when considering how much more polarized the House is than it used to be.Let’s consider the three most recent impeachments, that of Bill Clinton in 1998 and those of Trump in 2019 and 2021. Below, we plotted each member of the House relative to how that member’s congressional district voted in the preceding presidential contest (those being the 1996, 2016 and 2020 elections).Setting aside the impeachment issue for a moment, we see first that, in 1998, the dots are all much more clustered around the centerpoint — indicating far more congressional districts in which the 1996 results were not lopsided in one direction or the other. Over the next 20 years, the presidential margins in those districts expanded, a function of both gerrymandering and increased partisanship. This is also a function of how not-close the 1996 election was. Clinton’s rout of former senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) affects the dots’ placement as well.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe dots also show how much more common it was for a member of the House to represent a district that voted for the presidential candidate of the other party. Lots of purple dots — representing the nonpresidential party, or, in 1998, the Republicans — to the left of the centerline. Lots of orange to the right.On the subject of impeachment, though, party makes a big difference. Most of the orange dots above are light in color, meaning they are members of the president’s party who opposed impeachment. Most of the purple dots are dark: members of the opposing party who supported it.If we isolate those members who bucked their parties — members of the opposition who opposed impeachment or members of the president’s party who supported it — things look more interesting. A few defections in 1998, mostly among representatives representing districts that preferred the other party’s presidential candidate. Only two defections in 2019, including then-Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.), who would later become a Republican.And then there’s 2021.In this vote, there were no members of the opposing party who voted against impeachment. There were 10 Republicans who supported it — including five representing districts where Trump was favored by more than 10 points in the presidential race. (For districts where congressional-level data aren’t yet available, we used 2016 values.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe starkest outlier there is Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), part of the House Republican leadership. Her denunciation of Trump’s actions leading up to and during the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week was unflinching, providing fodder for Democrats giving speeches from the House floor as the impeachment vote loomed. She cast Trump’s actions in unusually nonpartisan terms, echoing the extent to which this highly partisan vote was nonetheless less partisan than one might have expected.Another statement, from a district that backed Trump by nearly 20 points, might have stood out even more.On Monday, Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) told a reporter that he would oppose impeaching the president. That position was very much in line with his approach to Trump since day one. When the vote came, though, Rice joined nine of his colleagues in supporting the effort.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It has been a week since so many were injured, the United States Capitol was ransacked, and six people were killed, including two police officers,” Rice said in a statement. “Yet, the President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were ‘perfectly appropriate.’”Those comments, it seems, pushed Rice in the other direction.“I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years,” the statement continued. “I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable.”And with that, Trump was impeached once again.",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightRepublicans, rather than defending Trump, have focused on process, arguing that the impeachment was rushed or would only further divide and inflame the country, and pointing to things Democrats have said and the media has done that they suggest demonstrate hypocrisy.That imbalance was particularly pronounced as the House debated his impeachment Wednesday. In fact, there were more Republicans supporting Trump’s impeachment or otherwise rebuking his conduct than actually defending or even litigating it.Story continues below advertisementMost notably, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) became the second top GOP leader in Congress’s two chambers in 24 hours to fault Trump, joining Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who signaled an openness to convicting Trump.AdvertisementMcCarthy opposed impeachment, but said: “That doesn’t mean the president is free from fault. … The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. These facts require immediate action by President Trump to accept his share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest and ensure President-elect Biden is able to successfully begin his term.”McCarthy said he supported a censure resolution against Trump instead.Story continues below advertisementTrump, to this point, hasn’t accepted responsibility. In fact, he said Tuesday that he saw nothing wrong with what he said before his supporters stormed the Capitol.McCarthy’s comments came shortly before another House Republican, Rep. Dan Newhouse (Wash.), announced his support for impeachment. But while others, like McCarthy, stopped short of that, a few others joined him in finding fault.AdvertisementRep. Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.), for instance, suggested Trump had erred in his “judgment.”“I’m not saying the president didn’t exercise poor judgment,” Arrington said. “But to criminalize political speech by blaming lawless acts on the president’s rhetoric is wrong.”Story continues below advertisementRep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) went further, saying Trump had indeed committed impeachable offenses. But Roy said that was not because he incited the attempted insurrection at the Capitol, as the single article of impeachment alleges. Rather, Roy cited Trump’s urging of Vice President Pence to overturn the election, a situation to which Roy objected in real time.“The president of the United States deserves universal condemnation for what was clearly, in my opinion, impeachable conduct: pressuring the vice president to violate his oath to the Constitution to count the electors,” said Roy, who is a former chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who led the effort to overturn the election results in Congress.AdvertisementAs the vote was taking place, Reps. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) and Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) also put out statements rebuking Trump.Story continues below advertisement“I strongly condemn the president’s rhetoric and his behavior,” McCaul said, adding, “Let me also say, there very well may have been impeachable offenses committed leading up to, and on, that tragic day.” McCaul objected to a rushed process, but acknowledged that more could come out about Trump’s actions that might make him regret his decision, saying such things could “put me on the wrong side of this debate.”Crenshaw added that “we condemn the president for the words and actions which contributed to these events, and encourage every member of Congress to similarly condemn.” Crenshaw also said Trump’s “actions were reckless. No President should ever, among other things, promote clearly unconstitutional theories that risk the stability of our nation and, in particular, do so to the detriment of the peaceful transition of power.”AdvertisementAn examination of the developments on the House floor shows there were by comparison few Republicans actually willing to delve into what Trump did and when.Story continues below advertisementRep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) qualified that he didn’t like Trump’s speech. But, somewhat similarly to Roy, he said he was more concerned about Trump suggesting Congress could decline to accept the results of the electoral college. And, like Arrington, he suggested Trump’s words were simply freedom of speech.“If we impeached every politician who gave a fiery speech to a crowd of partisans, this capital would be deserted,” McClintock said. “That’s what the president did. That is all he did.”Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) argued that Trump merely had “political Tourette’s” syndrome, in that he says what’s on his mind without a filter and that last week was no different.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Is he a clear and present danger? He clearly isn’t,” Issa said. “The president has acted substantially the same for four years. He has rallied his base, and he has, in fact, called for peaceful protest, as he did just a few days ago. … What happened last week was the result of anarchists who came loaded, prepared and with weapons.”Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) offered a similar defense.“There was no language in the president’s speech that incited or provoked violence,” Steube said. “In fact, at around the 18-minute mark, he stated and I quote, ‘Peacefully and patriotically, make your voices heard.’ You may think that he’s inciting violence because he believes there is election fraud. That’s his opinion.”Story continues below advertisementThe GOP’s most ready defense of Trump would indeed seem to have been citing this line from Trump’s speech. It was notably surrounded by plenty of other comments that could be read to spur drastic action — and plenty of past comments that suggested violence by his supporters. But even if that line provides some plausible deniability, what was particularly telling Wednesday was how few Republicans even invoked it. Besides another mention by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), it wasn’t really a feature off the defense. And apart from it, there was almost nothing in the way of actually addressing Trump’s culpability or lack thereof.AdvertisementIt sets up an interesting Senate trial, in which Trump’s defense will probably be forced to actually confront what he said and did more directly. But it’s also indicative of the position in which the GOP finds itself politically: It sees actually standing up for Trump as a less-productive response than diverting attention to other things.That might not mean Trump deserves impeachment, but it does indicate how much Republicans have decided they don’t actually want to have that conversation after the ugly scenes last week.",

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) left open the possibility of voting to convict at a trial, which would occur after Trump leaves office next week.During debate on the House floor, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Trump “bears responsibility” for last week’s violent takeover of the Capitol but argued against impeachment so close to the end of his term. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Trump “a clear and present danger” and said “he must go.”Here’s what to know:In his first public statement since getting impeached a second time, Trump condemned violence without mentioning his indictment for inciting the attack at the Capitol. “Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,” the president said in a video statement. He warned his supporters that upcoming demonstrations should remain peaceful.President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next week, has announced no public events Wednesday as Trump’s impeachment is debated on the House floor.An additional 5,000 members of the National Guard could arrive to support Inauguration Day security in Washington, city officials said Wednesday, which would increase the total to at least 20,000 in a rapidly swelling security apparatus focused on the Capitol.National Guard plan for inauguration expands to at least 20,000 troops in D.C., acting police chief saysBy Missy Ryan, Alex Horton, Matt Zapotosky and Dan Lamothe2:49 a.m.Link copiedlinkNational Guard forces from a growing list of states moved into positions across Washington on Wednesday as authorities scrambled to understand the extent of threats surrounding President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration and prevent a repeat of last week’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.Security officials conducted tabletop exercises to rehearse inauguration security and strengthen coordination among a massive patchwork of police, National Guard troops and federal personnel that is expected to fan out ahead of protests this weekend and the Jan. 20 transfer of power.By next week, the D.C. police chief said, upward of 20,000 guardsmen were expected to be in place to protect against violence, days after supporters of President Trump smashed their way into the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Biden’s electoral win.Read the full storyarrow-rightAdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementBiden urges Senate to not let Trump impeachment trial impede other workBy Colby Itkowitz1:49 a.m.Link copiedlinkBiden, who has tried to stay out of the debate around impeaching Trump, released a statement on the House vote, but urged lawmakers not to lose sight of the work to be done on the pandemic, the economy and his Cabinet nominations.“Today, the members of the House of Representatives exercised the power granted to them under our Constitution and voted to impeach and hold the president accountable,” Biden said. “It was a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience. The process continues to the Senate.”The president-elect then turned his comments to the coronavirus and the nation’s economic woes, and said he hopes the Senate can hold its impeachment trial “while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.”As Democrats marched toward impeachment since last week’s attack, Biden has been tepid in his support, saying the decision was up to the lawmakers and that he was focused on Jan. 20, when Trump would be gone and he could get to work on the issues devastating America.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementPelosi announces fines for lawmakers who refuse to walk through metal detectors installed after Capitol riotsBy Amy B Wang1:48 a.m.Link copiedlinkHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has announced fines of at least $5,000 for lawmakers who refuse to follow new screening protocols, including walking through metal detectors that were installed at the entrance of the House chamber after last Wednesday’s violent riots.Since then, several Republican lawmakers have refused to comply with the new safety measures, instead stepping around the metal detectors, ignoring police even after setting off the machines and loudly complaining in their refusals to comply with Capitol Police officers.Freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who has vowed to bring her handgun to Congress, on Tuesday ended up in a standoff with police after refusing to hand over her bag after setting off the metal detector.“Sadly, just days later, many House Republicans have disrespected our heroes by verbally abusing them and refusing to adhere to basic precautions keeping members of our Congressional community, including the Capitol Police, safe,” Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday night announcing the rule change.Pelosi said a lawmaker who refused to abide by the new safety protocols would incur a $5,000 fine for the first offense and a $10,000 fine for the second offense. The fines will be deducted directly from lawmakers’ salaries, she noted.“It is tragic that this step is necessary, but the Chamber of the People’s House must and will be safe,” Pelosi said.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementThe Founding Father who was impeached after leaving the Senate in shameBy Gillian Brockell1:10 a.m.Link copiedlinkWith the House having impeached Trump for a second time, outgoing Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the earliest his chamber would start a trial is after Trump has already left office. Whether an official can be impeached after leaving office has not been settled by the courts, and constitutional scholars do not agree on the matter.There is some historical precedent: The impeachments of Sen. William Blount in 1797 and Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 both occurred after the men were no longer in office.Read the full storyarrow-rightAdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementFirst hearing for a Biden nominee scheduled for FridayBy Amy B Wang12:09 a.m.Link copiedlinkThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will hold an open nomination hearing at noon on Friday for Avril Haines, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be the director of national intelligence, according to an item on the committee’s calendar.Haines would be the first of Biden’s nominees to receive a Senate hearing. With a few exceptions, Biden’s Cabinet picks will require Senate confirmation.Earlier Wednesday, Biden’s transition team urged “swift hearings and confirmations” for its national security nominees in light of reports of potential threats and additional violence across the country.“The team is engaging with the current administration to gain as much information as possible on the threat picture, and on the preparations being put in place to deter and defend against violent disruptions or attacks,” the transition team said in a statement.“The incoming team is also focused on laying the groundwork for a smooth handoff in power that will ensure continuous command and control across the homeland security and law enforcement components of the U.S. government.”A hearing for Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, has been scheduled for Jan. 19, the day before Inauguration Day.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementPelosi signs article of impeachment, speaks from lectern that was taken from chamber during Capitol siegeBy Felicia Sonmez and Paul Kane11:44 p.m.Link copiedlinkThe House Speaker's lectern was returned from the Senate side on Jan. 13. It had been stolen on Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. (The Washington Post)After the House voted Wednesday to impeach Trump for a second time, Pelosi addressed reporters at the Capitol, speaking from behind a lectern that photos last week showed had been carried out of the House chamber by one of the rioters.“It was not damaged,” a Pelosi spokesman said of the lectern, which had been abandoned on the Senate side of the Capitol after the would-be thieves apparently got tired of carrying it.In remarks before she signed the article of impeachment, Pelosi said she was doing so “with a heart broken over what this means to our country, of a president who would incite insurrection.”“Today, in a bipartisan way, the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States, that Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our country and that once again, we honor that oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help us God,” Pelosi said.Adam Johnson, 36, of Bradenton, Fla., is accused of theft of government property in connection with the lectern, in addition to trespassing on Capitol grounds, entering violently and committing disorderly conduct while there.Rachel Weiner contributed to this report.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementTrump: ‘I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week’By Amy B Wang11:30 p.m.Link copiedlinkPresident Trump on Jan. 13 said he \"unequivocally\" condemns the attack on the U.S. Capitol a week prior, adding that \"there must be no violence.\" (The White House)In a video statement released Wednesday, Trump said he “unequivocally” condemned the attack on the U.S. Capitol last week and warned his supporters that upcoming demonstrations should remain peaceful.“Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America great again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation’s most sacred traditions, and mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for,” Trump said in a five-minute video released shortly after the House voted to impeach him.Trump attempted to distance himself from the rioters, even though all evidence has shown they were overwhelmingly supporters of the president, drawn to Washington by his rhetoric and their shared grievance over his baseless claims that the presidential election was “stolen.”“No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans,” Trump said Wednesday. “If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it, and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it.”Appearing to read off a script, Trump said he had heard reports that there would be additional demonstrations, and said that while it was his supporters’ First Amendment right to convene and exercise their free speech, they must remain peaceful. There have been credible reports of additional violent pro-Trump protests planned between now and Inauguration Day, and the FBI warned this week that similar violence could break out at state capitols, as well.“I must emphasize there must be no violence, no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind,” Trump said.In the video, Trump made no mention of the election, and still did not concede that Joe Biden won a free and fair election. The remarks in the video also contradicted his own initial statement the night of the Capitol riot last Wednesday, in which he told his supporters to go home, adding: “We love you. You’re very special.”The video was released through the White House Twitter account; Trump’s main account, @realDonaldTrump, was permanently suspended last week on fears it could incite further violence. Trump alluded to the ban in his latest video, saying there had been an “unprecedented assault on free speech.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementIn Senate impeachment trial for Trump, question is whether chief justice or vice president would presideBy Robert Barnes11:10 p.m.Link copiedlinkA Supreme Court spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday about whether Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been in contact with Senate leaders about the impeachment trial of President Trump or whether he should preside if the trial takes place after Trump leaves office.Roberts was in the chair last year when the Senate acquitted Trump, fulfilling the constitutional command that “when the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.” But Trump will not be “the president” when the Senate holds its trial, and at least one expert on impeachment thinks that means that Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, should preside.Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who wrote a book on impeachment and who advised congressional Democrats last year, said he thought it would be up to the Senate majority leader and parliamentarian to decide who should preside at a Senate trial after Trump leaves office.“I think it is a straightforward answer, though: The chief would not preside because Trump would no longer occupy the presidential office,” Gerhardt wrote in an email. “Thus, VP Harris would preside, as is usual when the subject of an impeachment trial is not the president.”Gerhardt noted that the “Constitution empowered the CJ to preside over a presidential impeachment trial because the framers did not trust the VP who would otherwise preside but have an incentive to support a conviction.” In other impeachment matters — for instance, the impeachment of a judge — the vice president presides. But Gerhardt noted these are uncharted waters.As for the chief justice’s schedule, the Supreme Court after oral arguments Tuesday does not have another round of hearings scheduled until Feb. 22. Roberts will be busy on Wednesday — swearing in President-elect Joe Biden.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementMcConnell says there is ‘simply no chance’ that Senate could finish an impeachment trial before Trump is out of officeBy Felicia Sonmez10:49 p.m.Link copiedlinkSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday threw cold water on the idea of holding an impeachment trial during Trump’s last days in office, stating that it would not be possible for the chamber to complete those proceedings before Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.In a statement shortly after the House voted to impeach Trump for a second time, McConnell said the Senate process will begin “at our first regular meeting following receipt of the article from the House.”“Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week,” McConnell said.He added that even if the process were to begin this week, “no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office.”“In light of this reality, I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden Administration,” McConnell said.Earlier Wednesday, McConnell sent a note to his Republican colleagues telling them that he has not made a final decision on how he would vote on Trump’s impeachment. The New York Times reported that McConnell has told people that he sees the impeachment as a way “to purge [Trump] from the party.”McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have not tried to stop the Democrats’ efforts to hold Trump accountable for the Jan. 6 attack, though McCarthy voted against Trump’s impeachment Wednesday. Neither GOP leader has called on Trump to resign.Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that regardless of timing, there will be a Senate trial.“A Senate trial can begin immediately, with agreement from the current Senate Majority Leader to reconvene the Senate for an emergency session, or it will begin after January 19th,” Schumer said in a statement. “But make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again.”Trump’s actions, Schumer added, “cannot and must not be tolerated, excused, or go unpunished.”GOP Sens. Toomey, Sasse leave open possibility of voting to convict TrumpBy Amy B Wang and Seung Min Kim10:34 p.m.Link copiedlinkSens. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) left open the possibility of voting to convict Trump should the Senate hold an impeachment trial, even after the president leaves office.“I stand by my statements over the last week regarding President Trump and the role he played in the deadly riot at the Capitol,” Toomey said in a statement Wednesday after the House impeached Trump.Since the attack on the Capitol, Toomey has said he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses but shied away from pushing impeachment as the best possible option forward, citing the limited number of days remaining in Trump’s term. He has pushed Trump to resign instead, something the president is unlikely to do.“President Trump will be out of office before a Senate impeachment trial can begin. Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office is debatable,” Toomey said in his statement. “Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump’s lawyers.”Sasse said he would be limiting what he said in advance, as a juror, but blasted Trump for pushing lies and conspiracy theories about the election.“By January 6th, the lie had morphed into the nutty theory that Vice President Pence could violate his constitutional oath by formally declaring Trump the victor of an election he lost. When the President urged his supporters to disrupt the proceedings of the January 6th Joint Meeting of Congress by ‘fighting like hell,’ it was widely understood that his crowd included many people who were planning to fight physically, and who were prepared to die in response to his false claims of a ‘stolen election,’“ Sasse said in a statement Wednesday.“Since last Wednesday afternoon, before the Capitol was even cleared of rioters, it’s been obvious that the President was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law. Given the fact that the FBI is investigating widespread calls for violence across the nation in the coming days, every American has an obligation to lower the temperature. Six people, including two police officers, have already died. Lord, have mercy.”10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump. Here’s who they are. By Colby Itkowitz10:12 p.m.Link copiedlinkTen of the 211 House Republicans rebuked Trump Wednesday by voting with Democrats to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.The Republicans who broke from Trump as the president prepares to leave office in a week represent varying factions of the caucus, from Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third ranking in House GOP leadership, to Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), a moderate who has been in office for three decades, to Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.), a conservative who has been loyal to Trump.That the 10 Republicans who voted to charge Trump with “incitement of insurrection” could not so easily be lumped together suggests a fracturing of support for the president among Republicans after four years of his stranglehold over the party.The other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump are: Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), John Katko (N.Y.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Peter Meijer (Mich.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.), David Valadao (Calif.).Biden receives briefing from senior FBI, Secret Service officials on security landscape amid threats ahead of inaugurationBy Felicia Sonmez9:31 p.m.Link copiedlinkBiden was briefed Wednesday by senior officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and members of his national security team on the security outlook ahead of next week’s inauguration, the Biden transition team said in a statement.The briefing comes amid threats of “armed protests” in multiple cities, including the District of Columbia, and as officials scramble to avoid a potential repeat of last week’s attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.“Today, President-elect Biden received a briefing from senior officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, and key members of his national security team,” the Biden transition said. “The team is engaging with the current administration to gain as much information as possible on the threat picture, and on the preparations being put in place to deter and defend against violent disruptions or attacks.”The transition team also said it is “focused on laying the groundwork for a smooth handoff in power that will ensure continuous command and control across the homeland security and law enforcement components of the U.S. government.”The FBI warned Monday that armed far-right extremist groups are planning to march on state capitals this weekend, triggering a rush to fortify government buildings. In Washington, D.C., the Secret Service on Wednesday took command of security preparations at the Capitol and other federal buildings, backed by as many as 15,000 National Guard troops, thousands of police and tactical officers, and layers of eight-foot steel fencing.In Wednesday’s statement, the Biden team praised the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s decision to schedule a Jan. 19 hearing on the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas as Biden’s Homeland Security secretary and said it is “critical” that Biden’s national security nominees “receive swift hearings and confirmations.”Biden’s team receives daily security and operational briefings to ensure a smooth presidential transition, according to the statement.Carol D. Leonnig and Missy Ryan contributed to this report.In bipartisan rebuke, House members vote to impeach Trump an unprecedented second time, on charge of ‘inciting violence’By Donna Cassata and Felicia Sonmez9:29 p.m.Link copiedlinkThe House on Wednesday voted to impeach Trump on a charge of “inciting violence” against the U.S. government, making him the first president in U.S. history to have been impeached twice.The final vote count was 232 in favor and 197 opposed. Ten Republicans joined all Democrats present in voting to impeach Trump.The vote came seven days before Trump leaves office and one week after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, resulting in five deaths and endangering the lives of the vice president and members of Congress.Trump now faces a Senate trial after his term ends, when the chamber could vote on barring him from future elective office if he is convicted.The 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump are Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), John Katko (N.Y.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Peter Meijer (Mich.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.), Tom Rice (S.C.), Fred Upton (Mich.) and David Valadao (Calif.).Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s husband, who was in lockdown room with her, tests positive for the coronavirusBy Colby Itkowitz9:11 p.m.Link copiedlinkRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and her husband left the location they were in for a secure room where members and some staffers were waiting out the siege on the Capitol last week, she said.But when they got there, the room was overcrowded, and a group of maskless GOP lawmakers were huddled together in one part of the room.Before long, Pressley said she decided it wasn’t worth trading one threat for another, and she and her husband chose to return to the location that wouldn’t provide them the same protection from violence but wasn’t a coronavirus risk.And yet, Pressley revealed Thursday, her husband, Conan Harris, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Pressley herself has tested negative, she said in a statement.Calling her GOP colleagues “callous,” Pressley said their “arrogant disregard for the lives of others is infuriating, but not surprising and we are seeing the consequences of it daily, as several of my colleagues — and now my husband — test positive for covid-19.”Harris is the fourth known person who spent time in the lockdown room to have contracted the virus.In the secure room last week, Pressley checked on friends but grew increasingly uncomfortable with the growing congregation of maskless GOP colleagues.“This is crazy,” Pressley thought, according to a senior Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe what transpired in the room. “We’re not going to survive a terrorist attack to be exposed to a deadly virus.” It felt too risky to stay, so the congresswoman left the police-protected space for a less secure room where she wouldn’t be potentially exposed to the coronavirus.Apart from Pressley’s husband, three Democratic lawmakers in that room, including a 75-year-old cancer survivor, have tested positive for the coronavirus, and Democrats are enraged at the Republicans who they say got their colleagues sick.“The second I realized our ‘safe room’ from the violent white supremacist mob included treasonous, white supremacist, anti masker Members of Congress who incited the mob in the first place, I exited,” Pressley tweeted Tuesday. “Furious that more of my colleagues by the day are testing positive.”Throughout the day, House Democrats expressed unbridled outrage about the maskless lawmakers, adding to the already raw anger they have toward many of those same Republicans who they see as contributing to the incitement of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.",

The Senate now appears likely to hold a trial after Trump’s departure, an unprecedented scenario that could end with lawmakers barring him from holding the presidency again.The final vote was 232 to 197.Read: Article of impeachment against President TrumpOne of the final dramas of a tumultuous presidency, the impeachment unfolded against the backdrop of near-chaos in the House and uncertainty about where Trump’s exit leaves the GOP. Democrats and Republicans exchanged accusations and name-calling throughout the day, while Trump loyalists were livid at fellow Republicans who broke ranks — especially Cheney — leaving the party’s leadership shaken.The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach President Trump a second time after the deadly U.S. Capitol breach. (The Washington Post)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut despite the emotions stirred by the Capitol assault, the great majority of Republicans stood by the president, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). He argued on the House floor that while Trump bears responsibility for the attack on the Capitol, the snap impeachment would only “further fan the flames of partisan division.”McCarthy for the first time publicly endorsed a censure for Trump, but the call came too late to serve as an effective alternative to impeachment.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats made it clear Wednesday that censure would not suffice given the circumstances, with Trump riling up his supporters with false claims of election fraud, then urging them to march on Congress as it was certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.Washington GOP Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse called for President Trump’s impeachment on Jan. 13, one week after a mob stormed the Capitol. (The Washington Post)Story continues below advertisement“He must go,” Pelosi said. “He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”AdvertisementThe House took its final vote Wednesday afternoon, one week after the riot and just two days after the impeachment resolution was filed. It was a stunningly swift response from a House that took nearly three months to impeach Trump in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and contempt of Congress.But with just seven days remaining in Trump’s term, it became increasingly certain Wednesday that Trump would not be removed from office prematurely. The impeachment resolution for “incitement of insurrection,” however, also seeks Trump’s future “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.”Story continues below advertisementThe focus will now turn to how the trial will unfold in the Senate, which has never before held an impeachment trial for a former president.Biden issued a statement shortly after the House vote signaling his concern that his agenda not be sidelined. “I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,” Biden said.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused a request from Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to reconvene the Senate early to launch Trump’s trial. That means it can start the proceedings no sooner than Jan. 19 — a day before Biden’s inauguration.Story continues below advertisementMcConnell, who signaled through advisers Tuesday that he would be open to a possible conviction, said in a memo released as the House debated that there was no chance that a trial could be fairly concluded before the inauguration, even if he agreed to Schumer’s request. Previous presidential impeachment trials, he noted, took 83, 37 and 21 days.McConnell pointedly left open the possibility that he might vote to convict Trump.“I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” he said in the note, first sent to his fellow Republican senators.AdvertisementSchumer, for his part, suggested determination to hold the trial even with Trump gone from the White House. “Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again,” he said.Story continues below advertisementMcCarthy called on the House floor for Trump to “quell the brewing unrest,” and with Republican votes in the balance, Trump quickly issued a brief written statement: “I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” he said. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.”Later Wednesday evening, Trump issued a five-minute video denouncing the protesters: “Mob violence goes against everything I believe in, and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence.”AdvertisementBut the statements came too late for the clutch of Republicans who voted to impeach. Instead, several cited his impromptu remarks the previous day claiming his actions had been “totally appropriate.”Story continues below advertisementThe Republicans who broke from Trump included senior leaders such as Cheney, the GOP conference chairwoman; Rep. John Katko (N.Y.), the top GOP member of the Homeland Security Committee; and Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), a former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. But junior members such as freshman Rep. Peter Meijer (Mich.) and second-term Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio) also voted for impeachment.Some, such as Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), have been sharply critical of Trump in the past. Others, such as Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.), have hardly ever said a cross word about him.“I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice,” Rice said in a statement. “But, this utter failure is inexcusable.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOther Republicans voting to impeach Trump were Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.) and David G. Valadao (Calif.).Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, said the fact that only nine Republicans joined Cheney, and the dam did not break in a more dramatic way, showed that Trump retained wide support within the GOP.Asked if Trump could still be an effective leader of the party, Jordan said, “Of course he is. Of course he is. His support is strong because the American people appreciated that over the past four years he did more of what he said he would do than any president in my lifetime.”Several other Republicans declined to comment on Trump’s future, saying instead that the lopsided GOP vote reflected concerns about the impeachment process and the political environment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It actually represents a feeling among Republicans — even Republicans who are disappointed with this president — that with only seven days left to go in his term and with the toxic political environment being what it is, that there’s a real need in the country to lower the temperature,” said Rep. Garland “Andy” Barr (R-Ky.). “This is viewed by a lot of Americans as an act of political vengeance.”Many GOP members said they were struggling to reconcile their anger at last week’s events, and Trump’s culpability in them, with their fears of escalating violence and threats directed at lawmakers.“This isn’t a fun time, that’s for sure,” said Valadao, who said he was undecided just hours before voting to impeach.Democrats encouraged the handful of Republicans who came to the floor Wednesday in support of impeachment. When Newhouse broke publicly with Trump on the House floor, colleagues across the aisle delivered applause.Advertisement“These articles of impeachment are flawed, but I will not use process as an excuse,” he said. “There is no excuse for President Trump’s actions.”But most Republicans speaking Wednesday put little distance between themselves and Trump. Many sidestepped the actual charge against Trump, instead arguing that the Democrats were being divisive and that impeachment was unnecessary so close to Trump’s departure.Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), leader of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who had embraced the “Stop the Steal” effort that culminated in the Jan. 6 rally, warned Democrats that they would only embolden Trump supporters.“You believe that your hunger will be finally satiated by impeaching this president without completion of his full term of office,” Biggs said. “Instead of stopping the Trump train, his movement will grow stronger, for you will have made him a martyr.”The scene in the Capitol highlighted how fluid the political landscape has become one week before the departure of a president who has aggressively shaken up politics for four years. Cheney and Jordan were emerging as leaders of what are roughly anti- and pro-Trump factions of the GOP, with the party’s nominal leader, McCarthy, somewhere in the middle.Democrats, meanwhile, face what is likely to be Pelosi’s last term as speaker without a clear successor and with the narrowest congressional majority in decades — often a recipe for trouble as voters’ expectations exceed a party’s ability to deliver.In a sign of the House GOP’s tenuous political standing, McCarthy convened a call about two hours after the vote with his top financial donors. A slew of Fortune 500 companies in recent days have sworn off donations to the Republicans who voted to overturn the electoral college results, a group that includes McCarthy.McCarthy told the donors that he called Biden on Tuesday and “pledged to work together” with the new administration, according to a participant in the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private call.McCarthy also tried to reassure the wealthy contributors that he rejected the conspiracy theory that antifa was responsible for last week’s violence and said Trump deserved “some of the responsibility” for the attacks.The most immediate fallout from the impeachment effort appears likely to occur inside the Republican Party, as several Trump loyalists called for Cheney to immediately resign her leadership position. A petition for her resignation circulated among GOP offices in the Capitol as hard-right members seethed over her role in backing Trump’s ouster.Cheney on Wednesday insisted she would not resign: “I’m not going anywhere,” she told reporters. “Our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis. That’s what we need to be focused on.”Democrats, meanwhile, prepared for a new governing reality — with Biden assuming the presidency in a week and Democrats taking the narrowest of Senate majorities, with Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris poised to break 50-50 ties.With some Democrats openly floating a delay in transmission of the impeachment measure to allow the Senate to confirm at least some of Biden’s Cabinet nominees, Pelosi on Wednesday did not respond to questions about her plans.Some Republicans predicted that their internal bloodletting over Trump would soon be swept aside once Democrats take unified control in Washington.“We’re going to get through this, and we’re going to be united, because Speaker Pelosi is going to bring some very dangerous policy to the House floor that’s frankly going to divide them and unite us,” said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), a junior member of the party leadership.\n\nKaroun Demirjian and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.",

Garland “Andy” Barr (R-Ky.). “This is viewed by a lot of Americans as an act of political vengeance.”Read: Article of impeachment against President TrumpAs the articles of impeachment now move to the Senate for a trial, several Republicans have signaled a willingness to convict Trump, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who told colleagues earlier in the day that he had “not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” according to his office.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSeveral Senate Republicans expressed similar sentiments,  a strikingly different tone from the cries of a “witch hunt” during Trump’s first impeachment in December 2019.“I stand by my statements over the last week regarding President Trump and the role he played in the deadly riot at the Capitol,” said Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has called for Trump to resign over the attacks. “Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office is debatable. Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump’s lawyers.”Other Senate Republicans focused on how everything started, with Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the election and his baseless insistence that they had been rigged.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who has been critical of Trump’s efforts to subvert the election, said everything that has happened since Nov. 3 is the result of a “particular lie.”“When the President urged his supporters to disrupt the proceedings of the January 6th Joint Meeting of Congress by ‘fighting like hell,’ it was widely understood that his crowd included many people who were planning to fight physically,” Sasse said in a statement, “and who were prepared to die in response to his false claims of a ‘stolen election.’ ”\n",

        "article": "The bipartisan impeachment vote in the House against President Trump on Wednesday set up a politically explosive reckoning for Senate Republicans, who spent four years enabling Trump’s behavior but in the wake of last week’s Capitol riot are grappling with how — or whether — to punish him with just seven days left in office.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe most striking position came from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said Wednesday that he will consider convicting Trump on inciting the attempted insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — a remarkable break between the two men who worked in lockstep for four years, even as the majority leader continually deflected questions about Trump’s untoward conduct and rhetoric.It was also a dramatic shift from his position during Trump’s first impeachment a year ago, when he publicly stressed that he was “not an impartial juror” and privately worked in concert with White House officials to map out the president’s eventual acquittal in the Senate.Read: Article of impeachment against President Trump“While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” McConnell said in a message to his colleagues, an excerpt of which was released by his office.The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach President Trump a second time after the deadly U.S. Capitol breach. (The Washington Post)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMcConnell also pressed pause on an impeachment trial that would occur before Trump leaves the White House on Jan. 20, slowing the rapid momentum and furor that snowballed in Congress as the scale and potential catastrophe of the Jan. 6 siege continued to sharpen.Even with McConnell’s position giving senators cover on a conviction, multiple senior GOP officials said it was too early to determine whether a critical mass of Senate Republicans would vote to punish Trump for his role in inciting a violent mob of his supporters to storm and rampage the Capitol, leaving five people dead.To convict Trump, 17 of the 50 Republicans in the new Senate would have to join the chamber’s 50 Democrats to meet the necessary two-thirds threshold. While a few GOP senators are now considered likely to oppose Trump, others across the spectrum of the party would face enormous pressure to abandon their years-long support of him and publicly rebuke him. Twenty GOP-held seats are on the ballot in 2022.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMost Republican senators have not expressed a public position on impeachment, leaving colleagues and others to try to parse their words for any hint of how they might feel. Some have directly criticized Trump for his role in inciting the riot, including Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who said Trump “bears responsibility” for the mayhem, and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who made similar comments.If two-thirds of the Senate convicted Trump, a second vote would determine whether he would be barred from ever seeking federal office again. A simple majority would determine that outcome.Given the parameters that guide Senate impeachment proceedings of a president, McConnell said Wednesday that Trump had “simply no chance” of a “fair or serious trial” before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in. His office informed aides to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) earlier Wednesday that he would not agree to immediately reconvene the Senate this week, according to a person familiar with the matter, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss internal GOP dynamics, despite pressure from Schumer to invoke rarely used emergency powers that allow the two Senate leaders to unilaterally reconvene.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Even if the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office,” McConnell said in a statement after the House impeached Trump on a bipartisan, 232-to-197 vote. “This is not a decision I am making; it is a fact.”McConnell is poised to remain majority leader until at least Jan. 22, when election results from the two Senate runoff races in Georgia will be certified and Democratic Sens.-elect Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will be eligible to be sworn in. McConnell and Schumer could jointly work out the rules that would govern Trump’s second impeachment trial, although once Democrats formally take the majority, Schumer and his ranks could formalize a rules package on a party-line vote.It's also unclear who would preside during a Senate impeachment trial of a former president. A Supreme Court spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday about whether Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been in contact with Senate leaders about any Senate proceedings, and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), in her role as president of the Senate, could conceivably preside.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith no apparent effort on McConnell’s part as of now to actively persuade or dissuade his colleagues on an impeachment vote, it was unclear how much political cover his position would provide — particularly as various Republican senators navigate their own personal home-state political dynamics as they weigh a Trump conviction.For nearly 24 hours, the outgoing majority leader had remained quiet to other GOP senators — even those seen as some of his closest lieutenants — on reports that he was pleased with the House’s move to rapidly impeach Trump and was leaning in favor of convicting him, according to Republican officials.That silence, people familiar with the matter said, frustrated some Senate Republicans who were seeking guidance or at least some insight into the majority leader’s thinking on what would be an unprecedented second impeachment trial of a U.S. president.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhile other increasingly vocal critics of the president emphasized that they, too, were open to conviction, allies of Trump within the Senate Republican Conference continued to line up in his defense — deepening a rift among GOP senators that began as Trump falsely amplified baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in the presidential election that he lost.Trump will almost certainly face a bigger rebuke than just the one Senate Republican — Mitt Romney of Utah — who voted to convict him last February. But the views of other GOP senators who flocked to Trump’s defense Wednesday underscored just how difficult it appeared to be as of now for 17 Republicans to ultimately decide to find him guilty of inciting an insurrection.Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said Wednesday after the House impeachment vote that for the past week, “it’s been obvious that the President was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Everything that we’re dealing with here — the riot, the loss of life, the impeachment, and now the fact that the U.S. Capitol has been turned into a barracks for federal troops for the first time since the Civil War — is the result of a particular lie,” Sasse said.He added that while he would not weigh in on the merits of impeachment because he is a juror, “President Trump has consistently lied by claiming that he ‘won the election by a landslide,’ and by promoting fanciful conspiracy theories about dozens of topics and people connected to the Nov. 3 election.”Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has emerged as one of the president’s fiercest critics since Trump lost reelection to Biden in November, said he continues to believe the outgoing president should immediately resign and, like McConnell, made clear he was also weighing a conviction.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office is debatable,” said Toomey, who plans to retire after his term. “Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump’s lawyers.”But a faction of the GOP conference continued to line up behind Trump, contending that a fraught impeachment fight would only be divisive and risk antagonizing supporters of the president who will still retain backing from a significant part of the party’s base.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who had remained an ardent Trump ally despite the turbulence of last week, reiterated that he opposes impeachment and said in a veiled reference to McConnell that “as to Senate leadership, I fear they are making the problem worse, not better.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“To my Republican colleagues who legitimize this process, you are doing great damage not only to the country, the future of the presidency, but also to the party,” Graham said. “The millions who have supported President Trump and his agenda should not be demonized because of the despicable actions of a seditious mob.”In private, some GOP senators questioned Democrats’ level of commitment in impeaching Trump, pointing to comments made by Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat, that suggested the House could simply hold off sending the article of impeachment to the Senate to delay a trial and free up floor time for members of Biden’s Cabinet to be confirmed.In McConnell’s message to senators Wednesday, obtained by The Washington Post, he acknowledged that he did not know when the House will transmit the articles to the Senate, though McConnell added that it could be shortly after it is adopted.Still, House Democrats want the Senate to act “as soon as possible,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said, signaling that the impeachment article was likely to be transmitted without delay. In a statement, Schumer promised that Trump will get a “fair trial” but added that Trump’s conduct “cannot and must not be tolerated, excused, or go unpunished.”Some Senate Republicans were also concerned that House Democrats were setting a precedent for a rushed impeachment of future presidents, according to people familiar with the conversations.“The House impeachment process seeks to legitimize a snap impeachment totally void of due process,” Graham said. “No hearings. No witnesses. It is a rushed process that, over time, will become a threat to future presidents.” \n\nErica Werner and Robert Barnes contributed to this report.",

        "article": "When Donald Trump on Wednesday became the first president ever impeached twice, he did so as a leader increasingly isolated, sullen and vengeful.With less than seven days remaining in his presidency, Trump’s inner circle is shrinking, offices in his White House are emptying, and the president is lashing out at some of those who remain. He is angry that his allies have not mounted a more forceful defense of his incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol last week, advisers and associates said.Support our journalism.

Giuliani, one of his most steadfast defenders, is also fracturing, according to people with knowledge of the dynamics between the men.Story continues below advertisementTrump has instructed aides not to pay Giuliani’s legal fees, two officials said, and has demanded that he personally approve any reimbursements for the expenses Giuliani incurred while traveling on the president’s behalf to challenge election results in key states. They said Trump has privately expressed concern with some of Giuliani’s moves and did not appreciate a demand from Giuliani for $20,000 a day in fees for his work attempting to overturn the election.AdvertisementAs he watched impeachment quickly gain steam, Trump was upset generally that virtually nobody is defending him — including press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, economic adviser Larry Kudlow, national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, according to a senior administration official.“The president is pretty wound up,” said the senior administration official, who, like some others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. “No one is out there.”The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach President Trump a second time after the deadly U.S. Capitol breach. (The Washington Post)\n[Read: Article of impeachment against President Trump]\nStory continues below advertisementOne of Trump’s few confidants these days is Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who broke with the president last week over attempts to overturn the election only to be welcomed back in the president’s good graces a couple of days later. Graham traveled to Texas on Tuesday in what was Trump’s last scheduled presidential trip, spending hours with Trump aboard Air Force One talking about impeachment and planning how Trump should spend his final days in office.Advertisement“The president has come to grips with it’s over,” Graham said, referring to the election. “That’s tough. He thinks he was cheated, but nothing’s going to change that.”The president as pariah: Trump faces a torrent of retribution for his role in the Capitol siegeTrump asked Graham to lobby fellow senators to acquit him in his eventual impeachment trial, which Graham did from Air Force One as he worked through a list of colleagues to phone. A few senators called Trump aboard the presidential aircraft on Tuesday to notify him of their intent to acquit. During the flight home, Graham said, he tried to calm Trump after Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 House GOP leader, announced she would vote to impeach.“I just told him, ‘Listen, Mr. President, there are some people out there who were upset before and are upset now, but I assure you, most Republicans believe impeachment is bad for the country and not necessary and it would do damage to the institution of the presidency itself,” Graham recalled. He said he told Trump, “The people who are calling on impeachment are not representative of the [Republican] conferences.”Trump told reporters Tuesday that the drive toward impeachment was causing “tremendous anger” and posed a “tremendous danger to our country.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAlthough he has shown flashes of anger over his impeachment — and is livid with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for leaving open the possibility that he might vote to convict — Trump privately has told advisers that he does not believe he will be removed from office before his term expires Jan. 20, according to people familiar with the conversations.Many of the president’s advisers and outside associates share that mind-set. As one put it, “Whoop-de-do.”McConnell effectively guaranteed that outcome Wednesday, releasing a schedule after the House impeachment vote that would push a trial until after President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump’s failure to act after mob stormed the CapitolTrump has been more concerned with other actions that could have serious consequences for his post-presidential life, according to people familiar with the president’s concerns. The developments include Twitter and other social media companies suspending his accounts, the PGA of America canceling a golf tournament at one of his properties, and Deutsche Bank announcing it would no longer finance his developments.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump carried on with various activities Wednesday. As the House debated his impeachment, Trump issued a statement calling on his supporters to stand down.“In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” the statement said. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You.”Minutes after the House voted to impeach him for a second time, Trump held a private ceremony in the East Room to award the National Medal of Arts to country singer Toby Keith, a senior administration official said.President Trump on Jan. 13 said he \"unequivocally\" condemns the attack on the U.S. Capitol a week prior, adding that \"there must be no violence.\" (The White House)The White House released a video Wednesday evening featuring Trump seated behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office pleading with supporters not to engage in further violence. “Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,” he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA senior administration official said Kushner, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino and Pence persuaded Trump to film the video, telling him it could boost support among weak Republicans. They asked him not to mention impeachment, and he didn’t.Still, in a stark illustration of Trump’s isolation, the White House did not mount a vigorous defense Wednesday as House members debated his fitness for office and, ultimately, voted to impeach him. The president’s aides did not blast out talking points to allies. His press secretary did not hold a briefing with reporters. His advisers did not do television interviews from the White House’s North Lawn. His lawyers and legislative affairs staffers did not whip votes or seek to persuade lawmakers to vote against impeachment.This is both because there was no organized campaign to block impeachment and because many of his aides believe Trump’s incitement of the riot was too odious to defend. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who was central to the president’s defense in his first impeachment a year ago, told other staffers to make sure word got out that he was not involved in defending Trump this time, according to one aide.“I just think this is the logical conclusion of someone who will only accept people in his inner orbit if they are willing to completely set themselves on fire on his behalf, and you’ve just reached a point to where everyone is burned out,” a senior administration official said. “Everyone is thinking, ‘I’ll set myself on fire for the president of the United States for this, for this and for this — but I’m not doing it for that.’ ”A former senior administration official in touch with the White House said in describing the staff mind-set: “People are just over it. The 20th couldn’t come soon enough. Sometimes there’s a bunker mentality or us-versus-them or righteous indignation that the Democrats or the media are being unfair, but there’s none of that right now. People are just exhausted and disappointed and angry and ready for all this to be done.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne of Trump’s only White House defenses came from Jason Miller, a senior political adviser. He did not defend the president’s conduct but rather argued that those who voted to impeach him would pay a political price. Miller sent reporters a two-page polling memo from Trump campaign pollster John McLaughlin saying that a majority of voters in presidential battleground states were opposed to impeachment and to “Big Tech censorship,” a reference to Twitter and other social media companies suspending Trump’s accounts.“It’s a massive miscalculation by the Democrats and the Liz Cheneys of the world who are massively disconnected from the grass roots that votes in primaries,” Miller said.Inside the remarkable rift between Donald Trump and Mike Pence“The grass roots and the base support is strong for him,” Miller added. “That’s really what matters. Washington is a very fickle town, and President Trump has never staked his strength as being in the nation’s capital. It’s always been out with the real people.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOther than family members, the president is mainly talking to Meadows, Scavino, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and personnel director Johnny McEntee. Hope Hicks, counselor to the president and long one of his closest confidantes, has been checked out for some time, according to people familiar with her status.Other than his trip to Texas, Trump’s public schedule has been empty, and he is said to be doing little these days besides watching television and fulminating with this coterie of loyalists about Republicans not defending him enough.Several aides laid blame for the situation not only on Trump but also on Meadows, because the chief of staff indulged Trump’s delusion that the election was rigged and fed him misinformation about alleged voter fraud.“He is the one who kept bringing kook after kook after kook in there to talk to him,” one adviser said.In the days after Twitter banned Trump from its platform, McEntee pushed the president to migrate to other social media sites, such as Parler. But Kushner and Scavino pushed back and stopped the president from joining the fringe platform, according to a person familiar with what happened who confirmed a CNN report.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSome current and former advisers described the impeachment as a sad ending that was unnecessary, propelled by a president who could not simply accept a loss and a vast array of aides willing to prop him up.Some of Trump’s longtime advisers, including Kellyanne Conway, lament that the president has not been able to use these final weeks to burnish his legacy.“From the time the electors certified the results to the time the president leaves office should have been spent reviewing and reliving the policy accomplishments of his four years and reminding Americans we are more peaceful or prosperous,” said Conway, a former senior counselor to the president who did not participate in the “Stop the Steal” activities aimed at overturning the election. “Instead of celebrating the accomplishments of the first term, we all watched in horror while the Capitol was run over.”Another former senior administration official, who has been briefed on some of the president’s recent private conversations, said Trump has expressed anger not only with Pence and some of his aides but also with longtime media defenders who have deserted him, including Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel, and others he believes have not fiercely defended him, including Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham.“He is feeling increasingly alone and isolated and frustrated,” this official said. “One of the metrics by which he’s often judged any number of things is: ‘Who’s out there saying good things about me or fighting on my behalf?’ And he never seemed to think there were enough people doing it strongly enough.”Now, in the final days, this official said, “it’s like death by a thousand cuts.”\n\n\n",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAnd that’s just in the past few days for President Trump, who after ruling Washington for nearly four years through a mix of bullying, intimidation, patronage and a sense that his willingness to spread falsehoods and misinformation would have no consequences is suddenly facing a torrent of retribution from those who long excused his behavior or were too scared or powerless to confront it.The fallout on Trump for his role in riling up thousands of supporters in a speech ahead of their deadly siege on the U.S. Capitol last week has intensified quickly — leaving the world’s most powerful leader as a pariah in many quarters, more isolated than ever.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump won 74 million votes in the November election — the second-most ever behind President-elect Joe Biden’s 81 million — but Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have cut him off from easily reaching those supporters in the real-time stream of explosive, demeaning and sometimes dangerous missives that have defined his presidency. Three banks, two real estate companies and the 2022 PGA Championship tournament have severed ties with the Trump Organization at a time when Trump and his family are facing mounting pressure from massive financial debts.Leaders in tiny Luxembourg canceled meetings with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Belgian leaders condemned the attack on the Capitol, prompting the top U.S. diplomat to scrap a final foreign trip to Europe this week. And some Republicans — beyond Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), the lone GOP lawmaker to buck Trump in January’s impeachment trial — voiced support for the second impeachment effort from Democrats on Wednesday.“There has never been a greater betrayal by a president,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking House Republican, said in a statement ahead of the vote. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reportedly floated the idea of censuring Trump, though he opposed impeachment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The House of Trump is unraveling, and it’s what happens when he’s about to lose power,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. “He was a bully president and so people were fearful of him, but with only a few days left in his tenure, people realize he’s about to be an ex-president with a boatload of legal suits and a brand that is no longer neon.”Backlash to riot hobbles Trump’s business as banks, partners flee the brandTrump and his allies lashed out at the widening condemnation. In remarks Tuesday in Alamo, Tex., where he toured a section of border wall, Trump declared that “free speech is under assault like never before,” positioning himself as a victim of the “greatest and most vicious witch hunt” in the nation’s history. Before the trip, the president insisted that his 70-minute address to supporters on Jan. 6 — in which he repeated false claims that he had won the election, implored Vice President Pence and McConnell to block Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory and urged supporters to march on the Capitol — was “totally appropriate.”Trump’s son Eric blamed the damage to the family business on liberal “cancel culture” ahead of Democratic New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s announcement Wednesday that the city would cut $17 million in contracts with the Trump Organization over operations of two ice rinks, a golf course and the Central Park Carousel.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It is something that they have been doing to us and others for years,” Eric Trump told the Associated Press. “If you disagree with them, if they don’t like you, they try and cancel you.” The younger Trump then abruptly hung up the phone when asked if the president had incited the crowd, the wire service reported.The moment has marked a dramatic turnabout for a president who had spent four years using his private resorts and golf courses — including Mar-a-Lago in South Florida and Trump International Hotel in Washington — as places of official government business, charging foreign governments and American taxpayers millions of dollars.Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump’s failure to act after mob stormed CapitolAnd despite his son’s eagerness to pin the notion of cancel culture on liberals, Trump has often governed as the canceler in chief, calling for boycotts of brands including Goodyear, Macy’s, Harley-Davidson, the National Football League and a host of media organizations.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFor years, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube resisted public pressure from liberal groups to moderate or suspend Trump’s accounts. In the wake of the Capitol siege, all three have blocked his access or taken them down, citing evidence that his posts were continuing to foment potential violence.“The platforms definitely didn’t want to be in this situation — they arrived here under unprecedented circumstances,” said Daphne Keller, a former legal adviser to Google who now works at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center. “The cynical way to look at it is that before the election, they were afraid to antagonize Republicans too much because Republicans could really punish them politically. After the election, the Republicans did not have as much power and it became politically easier. Then, the flash point last week provided a really clear moment when the decision seemed very justified to many people.”Keller cautioned, however, that the backlash to Trump has been limited to “an abrupt shift among elites” that has not yet been reflected in the president’s far-right base. The president also has maintained vocal support from most conservative lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close ally who briefly distanced himself from Trump last week but flew with him Tuesday to Texas on Air Force One.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAnd though Trump clashed with Pence over his insistence that the Constitution offered him no power to stop Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory, the vice president resisted calls from Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment that would allow the Cabinet a path to removing Trump from office.QAnon reshaped Trump’s party and radicalized believers. The Capitol siege may just be the start.Still, the rejection of Trump is hitting closer to home. Belichick, the Super Bowl-winning coach who Trump views as an ally, took the extraordinary step of declining his offer for the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Several high-ranking White House aides — including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf and deputy White House national security adviser Matthew Pottinger — have resigned in the wake of the siege.And McConnell on Wednesday left open the possibility of voting to convict Trump in the Senate after the House impeachment, saying in a statement that “I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOverseas, European leaders “will be extremely relieved to see the back end of the Trump administration,” Brookings Institution analyst Thomas Wright said. “It’s a combination of how they felt all along, but crucially, the events of the last week really did shock Europe and the world. They don’t see why they ought to pretend everything is fine.”Timothy L. O’Brien, author of the biography “TrumpNation,” said the backlash from Republicans, especially McConnell, is probably “creating vast wells of unquenchable resentment” in the president. He predicted Trump will seek revenge on GOP leadership by continuing to hold campaign-style rallies and supporting insurgent candidates.But O’Brien said it was the economic pain to Trump’s businesses — and the blows to his self-esteem through the loss of his social media platforms and snubs from the PGA and Belichick — that are probably more hurtful to him.“For someone who has had his nose pressed against the glass of public approval for most of his life over things that others find silly,” O’Brien said, “Donald Trump can’t live without them.”\n",

Amazon’s web services division cut off the Trump-friendly social media site Parler, which was also removed from the Google and Apple app stores.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)The Google-owned site’s decision to cut President Trump off from the site follows decisions by other social media giants to restrict Trump on their platforms. (The Washington Post)Together, the swift actions by tech companies demonstrated their ability to silence or significantly dampen the speech of even the most powerful voices in U.S. society. They raised fresh questions about the power of tech companies — which Dorsey alluded to — and the balance between free speech and public safety, even as the moves were lauded.Dorsey, along with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a strong proponent of building platforms that can encompass as many voices as possible. That latitude and pro-free speech stance was extended even further with politicians. Twitter — like Facebook — has long given exemptions to public figures regarding their hate speech policies on the grounds that what they said was newsworthy and worthy of public debate. The decisions last week, to effectively silence those voices, Dorsey pointed out, would have huge ramifications.“They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning,” he wrote. “And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.”Rachel Lerman contributed to this report.",
