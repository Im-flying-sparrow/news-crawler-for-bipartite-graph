        "article": "Lana Del Rey’s latest album rollout has been a real doozy.Most recently, Del Rey accused media publications of taking her “well-intentioned and believe it or not liberal comments” on President Trump and the Capitol riot “out of context.” Her tweets reference magazine coverage of a Monday guest spot on BBC Radio 1′s “Future Sounds,” in which she told host Annie Mac that Trump “doesn’t know that he’s inciting a riot.”Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right“I thought it was very, very clearly obvious that he knew what he was doing the whole way,” Mac replied, after which Del Rey continued: “Because he’s got delusions of grandeur.”The Grammy-nominated artist clarified Tuesday on Twitter that she had been making the argument that he “is so significantly impaired that he may not know what he was doing due to his significant lack of empathy,” which she identified earlier in the interview as an issue plaguing the country.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The madness of Trump,” Del Rey said to Mac, “as bad as it was, it really needed to happen. We really needed a reflection of our world’s greatest problem, which is not climate change but sociopathy and narcissism. Especially in America. It’s going to kill the world. It’s not capitalism, it’s narcissism.”Del Rey could very well claim that, by writing a summary of her interview instead of transcribing it, The Washington Post is also omitting some context. (You can listen to the “Future Sounds” episode here, if you so wish.) But the crux of her argument remains the same: Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing, which, as she says in a tweeted video, suggests his “sociopathy” is to blame. The backlash over this assertion coincides with the Democratic push to impeach Trump over his role in inciting the mob that breached the Capitol last week, a legislative effort several senior House Republicans have joined.In claiming that events of the past four years “really needed to happen,” Del Rey, a White woman, disregards that the populations most hurt by these dangerous developments look nothing like her. She was previously accused of racism in May when she announced her coming album, “Chemtrails Over the Country Club,” with an Instagram post that included a lengthy preamble lashing out at critics she alleges accused her of “glamorizing abuse” throughout her music career.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Doja Cat, Ariana [Grande], Camila [Cabello], Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes … cheating etc,” Del Rey wrote in the Instagram post. “Im fed up with female writers and alt singers saying that I glamorize abuse when in reality I’m just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all over the world.”It didn’t go unnoticed that Del Rey chose to name almost all Black women — save for Grande and Cabello, who is of Cuban and Mexican descent — before saying “there has to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me.” She clarified soon afterward that she had been advocating for people with “a more delicate personality, not for white woman [sic]” (which sparked yet another backlash, this time about why Del Rey implied that the Black women were not delicate, too).Del Rey tried to get ahead of a similar response this past Sunday, when she revealed the album artwork on Instagram. In a since-deleted comment, Del Rey noted that her friends on the cover, some of whom are not White, “are all a beautiful mix of everything.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“In 11 years working I have always been extremely inclusive without even trying to,” she continued, according to multiple reports. “My best friends are rappers my boyfriends have been rappers. My dearest friends have been from all over the place, so before you make comments again about a WOC/POC issue, I’m not the one storming the capital, I’m literally changing the world by putting my life and thoughts and love out there on the table 24 seven. Respect it.”In the BBC interview, Del Rey suggested she had felt pressure to present a more inclusive album cover — “That was the issue that was coming up” — and responded in the affirmative when Mac said, “Those women are your friends. Am I right? Those are people that are dear to you?”It inevitably became a “POC issue,” as Del Rey put it, given that her Instagram comment suggested she was exempt from race-related criticism because she has been involved with rappers. She concluded her tweeted defense on Tuesday by accusing her critics of sexism.“A woman still can’t get mad right?” she tweeted. “Even when a mob mentality tries to *incite.”Read more:Lana Del Rey announces a new album, but nobody is talking about the albumDecade influencers: Lana Del Rey is realLana Del Rey suddenly sounds like the poet laureate of post-truth",

        "article": "More than a million employees of the federal government and some private-sector workers are seeing smaller paychecks in January as they must now repay the Social Security taxes that President Trump delayed collection of from September through December.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightTrump forced most federal workers who fall under the executive branch, including the military, to take the tax deferment. About 1.3 million federal employees saw fatter paychecks for several months as the government stopped collecting the 6.2 percent tax that normally comes out of a worker’s paycheck to fund Social Security.Trump characterized the move as a tax cut and promised that it would not have to be repaid if he won reelection. In reality, Trump’s executive action in August was a tax loan that workers would have to repay. Only Congress can approve tax cuts.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This was a payroll tax loan as opposed to a payroll tax cut,” said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “Now people are getting hit with a lower paycheck in January. We knew the money would start coming due the same time the Christmas bills came due.”Most businesses, along with the U.S. Postal Service, Congress and the Supreme Court, declined to participate because they saw the move as confusing and potentially harmful to workers and employers. But federal workers in the executive branch making less than $104,000 a year did not have a choice. They received extra money in late 2020 and now they have to repay the loan, even as many continue to struggle during the coronavirus pandemic.Timothy James is among the many frustrated federal workers trying to adjust to a thinner paycheck. He gets paid biweekly and said his first paycheck in January was $300 less. James is a data analyst and father of two. He lost his second job during the pandemic. He and his wife just had a difficult discussion about what cuts they can make in their budget. They have asked for a temporary break on their car payments but aren’t sure if they will be approved.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“I feel like I got a pay cut even though I just had a star review from my manager. I feel like I’m being punished. It’s horrible,” James said. “Nobody in their right mind should have thought this would be a good idea.”Originally, the deferred taxes were supposed to be repaid from January through April, but the funding bills that Congress passed at the end of 2020 allowed the repayments to be spread over 12 months in an effort to ease the burden. The legislation also included a 1 percent raise for federal workers and a $600 stimulus payment for Americans making less than $75,000 a year.Federal employee unions applauded the 12-month repayment period, but they blamed the Trump administration for poorly communicating the situation to workers and forcing federal employees to participate in the first place.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Hopefully we’ll never have another president of the United States who’s intent on singling out his own workforce for a bad policy that was clearly intended to be an election-year ploy,” said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, adding: “The communication about this entire tax deferral from the very outset has been severely lacking.”American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley called the tax scheme “one more example of the way President Trump, his administration and his allies have bent policy and the truth to his personal political benefit, leaving everyday working Americans to deal with the consequences and pick up the pieces — whether it’s an unexpected tax bill just after the holidays or the broken glass on the floor of the Capitol.”The Trump administration blamed Congress for not making the payroll tax break permanent.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Any hardship you write about is attributable only to Congress. The president, as he did throughout the pandemic, took decisive action under his authorities to provide relief to Americans, and called on Congress to address the issue. Congress made their decision,” said Edie Heipel, deputy press secretary for the White House Office of Management and Budget.Trump had championed a payroll tax cut for all American workers over the summer as a way to get more money into people’s pockets during the pandemic. But Democrats and even some Republicans panned the idea, saying it helps only those currently on the job. The United States has nearly 20 million people receiving unemployment aid.For James, the federal worker, the biggest frustration is that his wife’s firm gave workers a choice on the tax break. She declined. But James was never given a choice.“If I had been given a choice, I would have said: ‘Heck no. I don’t want this,’ ” James said.",

Has disqualification ever happened?The House has initiated impeachment proceedings more than 60 times, according to its historian’s office, and voted to impeach 20 individuals -- 15 federal judges, one senator, one cabinet secretary and three presidents (Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998 and Trump in 2019). Of that group, eight judges were convicted and removed from office by the Senate. Three of the judges were also disqualified from holding office again. The last instance was in 2010, involving Thomas Porteous, a federal judge in New Orleans who was accused of taking cash and bribes from lawyers and bail bondsmen with cases before his court, making false statements in declaring personal bankruptcy, and lying to the Senate during his confirmation.3. What other repercussions would there be for Trump?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, Trump could lose many of the benefits afforded to former presidents, which, under the Former Presidents Act of 1958, include a lifetime pension, an annual travel budget and funding for an office and staff. Under that law, such perks are withheld from any president removed through the impeachment process (though he would still be entitled to Secret Service protection.) Whether a post-presidency conviction, such as Trump potentially faces, constitutes “removal” might be a question for the courts to decide. But experts point out that Congress could try to amend the law to make sure Trump loses his benefits.4. Is there enough time left to impeach Trump?There’s enough time for the House to pass one or more articles of impeachment -- formal written charges for consideration by the Senate -- but there’s little to no chance that the Senate would act by Jan. 20. Since the goal of many Democrats transcends removing Trump as president, however, acting quickly isn’t a necessity. In fact, it’s possible that House Democrats might delay sending any approved articles of impeachment to the Senate for a couple of months, so as not to interfere with the first 100 days or so of President-elect Joe Biden’s administration. No president has ever been convicted of impeachment, much less after leaving office, so the legality of a post-presidency impeachment conviction could be challenged, should it come to that.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement5. What exactly is an impeachable offense?Congress decides that. The U.S. Constitution says the president “shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” As Congress has defined it through the years, the phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” includes exceeding or abusing the powers of the presidency, or misusing the office for improper purpose or gain.6. Does Congress have other options?There’s been talk of deploying the 14th Amendment, enacted in the aftermath of the Civil War, to make Trump ineligible from running again. Section 3 of that amendment prohibits any government official who participated in or supported an insurrection against the U.S. from holding office in the future. Because a resolution citing the 14th Amendment wouldn’t seek to remove Trump from office, it may not require the same two-thirds Senate vote as an impeachment conviction, and it would sidestep a lengthy trial.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "article": "Until a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, the architectural legacy of Donald Trump was likely to have been some shiny modernist towers he constructed as a private real estate developer, a half-built border wall and, just last month, an executive order mandating classical architecture as the default Federal style. That order, issued by the president on Dec. 21, was titled “On Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture,” and it used some variant of the word “beauty” at least 11 times.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAnd then something ugly happened. Incited by Trump, who explicitly directed crowds to take their rage to the Capitol, insurrectionists stormed through one of the most iconic examples of classical architecture in the United States. They broke windows and doors, smashed furniture, sprayed fire extinguishers, discharged chemicals near historic art works and generally brought mayhem to a building that is supposed to, by the president’s own executive order, promote the “dignity . . . and stability of America’s system of self-government.”Before the attempted coup, architecture critics were debating the lasting impact of the president’s executive order. Now, they are talking about whether the damage to the Capitol should remain, in some form, as a permanent goad to memory, reminding visitors of the destruction wreaked by the president’s supporters. There is also grave concern about new security measures at the Capitol, a building that was once relatively open to the public, who came not just to admire its historic spaces, its paintings by John Trumbull and soaring dome decorated by Constantino Brumidi, but to sit face to face with their representatives and enact one of the basic accountability rituals of democratic government.Open insurrection was always their aimAs with so many other questions of Trump’s legacy, there is confusion about how to connect the before and after of the Jan. 6 events.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Dec. 21 executive order seemed, at the time, both risible and corrosive. It was intellectually vacuous, but also divisive in its attempt to mandate a single, historicist architectural style on almost all Federal buildings in the District of Columbia, and others around the country, including courthouses, agency headquarters and those expected to cost more than $50 million. By classical style, the authors meant architecture “derived from the forms, principles, and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman antiquity,” which would presumably exclude some of the most beloved buildings and monuments in the capital, including the East Building of the National Gallery and Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Yet no one believed that the president was much involved with this document, in part because it was written grammatically with complete sentences and paragraphs, and because the president’s own real estate portfolio suggests no consistent architectural design preferences, beyond a taste for gilding and made-for-TV opulence.Now, the discourse is about how all of this could have happened, how some considerable number of Americans who profess reflexive respect for the so-called symbols of democracy could attack one of the fundamental architectural symbols of democracy. Will the president be remembered for a mandate on classical architecture, or for a colossal act of iconoclasm, directed at the ideal embodiment of exactly the kind of architecture he claims to support?There’s no contradiction between the supposed celebration of classical architecture as policy and the destruction of it in practice. And there were warning signs in the executive order on “beautiful” architecture that presaged the rage that overwhelmed the Capitol. To understand the connections, we must look a bit more closely at the Dec. 21 document, how it came to be, and what kinds of damage the insurrectionists did while they occupied by the Capitol building.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe executive order exists not because of the president’s interest in architecture, but because his managerial incompetence created a space into which architectural opportunists inserted themselves, steering the administration to its current position on classical design. The central architect of this was Justin Shubow, the president of the National Civic Art Society, a nonprofit which got its start trolling design review meetings for the Frank Gehry-designed Eisenhower memorial almost a decade ago.Despite lacking any formal training in architecture, Shubow was appointed by Trump to the Commission of Fine Arts, the distinguished federal design oversight group that has, since 1910, played an important role in refining and guiding the design of government buildings. Shubow is likely the author or instigator of the executive order on classical architecture, which closely mirrors his ideas and obsessions, especially the maximalist position that only classical architecture is appropriate for federal buildings.When a draft of the executive order was leaked in February, it was clear that someone had tailored the language to appeal to the president, including specific mention of the architectural style of his home at Mara Lago as among the acceptable historicist idioms. It also echoed one of the essential pillars of Trumpism, its contempt for “elites” and experts. It specifically disempowers architectural professionals in favor of “public opinion,” and defines the public as people who aren’t “artists, architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, instructors or professors of art or architecture, or members of the building industry” — precisely the people whose expertise will be necessary to repair the Capitol and clean its damaged art works.Trumpism is a lifestyle disease, chronic in AmericaIt also included repeated references to beauty, which seemed to be aimed directly at the president, who uses the word frequently. The word is a rhetorical tick, an all-purpose intensifier, for the president, who invariably describes his fence on the country’s southern border as a “big, beautiful wall,” as well as employing the word to characterize coal, pipelines and, during the 2016 campaign, Ted Cruz getting booed. In his Jan. 6 speech that incited the acts of insurrection, he claimed falsely that stolen votes had robbed him of “a big, beautiful victory.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBy reiterating the word beautiful, however, the authors of the executive order didn’t just imitate the president’s rhetorical style, they seized upon the subjectivity of beauty — it is always “in the eye of the beholder” — to limit the diversity of federal architecture. A day after the executive order was released, the president announced four more appointments to the Commission of Fine Arts, all of them White men, all of them from a limited and sometimes ideologically combative traditionalist minority of designers. With the Trumpist takeover of the CFA complete, the body is now all White, all male and all in for one architectural style for the first time in generations.There is another word in Trump’s executive order that is even more telling than beauty, and that is “clients.” The goal of beautiful architecture, the authors wrote, is to “ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their clients, the American people.”That word seemed a lot more innocuous before angry insurrectionists shouted at Capitol Police phrases such as “we pay your salary” and “you work for us” and “this building is ours.” These are stock phrases of many protesters, but on Jan. 6, they took on new resonance, as does the word client. The problem isn’t the broad idea that our elected representatives work for us. They do. The problem is the idea that they work for me, or you, or anyone else, in an exclusive way, like a professional serves his or her clients. Government is simply too large, too manifold in its responsibilities, too diverse in the hundreds of millions of people it must serve to be imagined simply as your or my personal servant.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut that is what the rioters were demanding, unique ownership over the building and, by extension, an exclusive client relationship with the federal government, which must serve only their needs. That helps explain one of the more peculiar things that happened on Jan. 6, when rioters stormed the Capitol, beat down cops and defecated in the corridors, yet walked with relative respect between the velvet ropes in Statuary Hall. They attacked a symbol of democracy, but in a particular way. They didn’t specifically attack the paintings of Trumbull in the rotunda, which perpetuate basic historical fictions essential to White supremacy. Rather, they attacked the ability of other people — including the nation’s elected representatives — to use the building.“Beauty is the beginning of terror,” wrote the poet Rilke, in a very different context. But it could serve as a motto for the curious architectural subplot of the Trump years, and perhaps for other chapters of the Trump regime, too. Beauty is a beautiful word, but it must be used with care, like government.Few politicians in recent memory have spoken more often and more vaguely about beauty, but the word resonated with Trump’s followers, letting them project their ideas, their subjectivity, onto him. He offered to make the world beautiful again, for a targeted minority of Americans, who worry that life in a cosmopolitan, multiracial society will be bereft of the only kind of beauty they can imagine.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA few architectural ideologues heard the call, too, and now they have joined the fray. CFA members serve four-year terms, so their influence will continue, unless they destroy the moral gravitas and influence of the very body they have commandeered. The executive order on classical architecture could be rescinded on day one of a Biden administration, so it may be of little consequence. The damage to the Capitol, however, should be repaired only where necessary to the building’s stability and integrity, and left intact where it can serve a symbolic function.Its message? Where some people see beauty, others see ugliness, and you can’t have a democracy unless it serves all its clients, including with architecture as diverse as its population.\nThe Army Museum suggests that it won’t be co-opted by TrumpRhetoric is like a public park.

Entre ellos se encontraba la representante Liz Cheney (Wyoming), la republicana de tercer rango en el caucus republicano de la Cámara de Representantes, quien, siguiendo su conciencia, se expuso valientemente a severas críticas de aquellos en su partido que están a favor de Trump.Support our journalism.

Otros que buscan evitar el proceso de destitución están considerando censurar o tratar de obligar a Trump a renunciar. Después de cuatro años de indignación y humillación, al menos algunos líderes republicanos clave están rompiendo con el peor presidente de la historia moderna de Estados Unidos.No hay duda de que Trump merecía ser impugnado. Como explicó Cheney: “El presidente de Estados Unidos convocó a esta turba, reunió a la turba y encendió la llama de este ataque. Todo lo que siguió fue obra suya. Nada de esto hubiera sucedido sin el presidente. El presidente podría haber intervenido inmediata y enérgicamente para detener la violencia. No lo hizo\".Read in English: President Trump deserved impeachment. The Senate must convict him quickly.El proceso de destitución no significa que no existe la necesidad de una mayor investigación. Quedan grandes preguntas: ¿Qué tan cerca estuvo la turba de dañar a los miembros del Congreso o al vicepresidente? ¿Hubo una conspiración? ¿Participaron otros líderes republicanos? ¿Cuál fue la fuente de las bombas caseras descubiertas el 6 de enero? ¿Por qué el Capitolio estaba tan expuesto y el respaldo aparentemente no estaba disponible? ¿Qué medidas se deben tomar para que esto nunca vuelva a suceder?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAun así, aunque “se aclarará mucho más en los próximos días y semanas”, señaló Cheney, “lo que sabemos ahora es suficiente”. La escala conocida de la transgresión de Trump ya lo califica para un castigo severo, y el peligro que representa para la vida cívica estadounidense es demasiado importante para ignorarlo. El poder del proceso de destitución debe ser lo suficientemente ágil como para abordar una situación como Watergate, donde hubo tiempo para realizar una investigación profunda para determinar la culpabilidad del presidente, y la redada del Capitolio, en la que la culpabilidad obvia del presidente y el riesgo continuo que representa, justifican la destitución sumaria.Escucha el pódcast El Washington Post para conocer las últimas noticias en españolEs por eso que esperamos que McConnell reconsidere su reportada renuencia a avanzar rápidamente hacia un juicio. En cualquier caso, el mandato del presidente termina el próximo miércoles 20, pero destituirlo primero enviaría un mensaje importante. También sería incuestionablemente legítimo, considerando que algunos académicos creen que el Senado no tiene el derecho constitucional de juzgar, condenar y excluir del cargo futuro a un presidente después de que termine su mandato. Un juicio prolongado o tardado en el Senado podría eclipsar los días de apertura del presidente electo Joe Biden, retrasando la confirmación de sus nombramientos —con el consiguiente riesgo para la seguridad nacional— y descarrilando su agenda legislativa.Si McConnell se niega a convocar al Senado esta semana, los senadores deben actuar con rapidez una vez que se hayan reunido y dividir su tiempo entre juzgar a Trump y permitir el lanzamiento de la administración de Biden.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAt issue are changes to the vaccine rollout announced Tuesday by the Trump administration. Officials instructed states to begin vaccinating tens of millions of people with a high-risk medical condition putting them at increased risk of dying from the coronavirus, along with all adults 65 and older. Including both those groups immediately adds another 100 million people potential seeking shots, bringing the total to about 184 million and intensifying demand on already stressed sign-up systems.The Trump administration also said Tuesday it would begin releasing all available vaccine supply, rather than holding back second doses, as the incoming administration said last week it intended to do.Trump administration reverses stance, will no longer hold back second shots of coronavirus vaccineBiden’s team similarly wants states to expand eligibility for elderly residents, as some are already doing, said two transition officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe ongoing deliberations. But the officials said immediately including people 64 and under with a high-risk condition — which can mean everything from diabetes to obesity — would stretch supply and saddle states desperately in need of additional resources to augment their workforce and stand up mass vaccination sites.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBiden’s team was awaiting more details about another part of the plan to redirect some vaccine away from states moving more slowly to inoculate residents, but advisers looked unfavorably on a system that “punishes states,” said two officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the criticisms.“We believe we have to be straight with people about where we are,” said a senior transition official. “We want states to have the flexibility to move forward, but unfortunately this places an extreme responsibility on states without necessarily giving them the support to execute.”“We don’t want to unfairly create the expectation that someone can walk in and get a vaccine today when in reality we don’t have enough supply for nearly 200 million people,” the official said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementUnder the original recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 74 million people are in the first two priority groups for vaccination: health-care workers and the staff and residents of long-term-care facilities, followed by front-line essential workers and adults 75 and older. Adults 65 and older and those 16 to 64 with a high-risk medical condition were to come next, in what is known as phase 1c.The last-minute shift, announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar with fewer than eight days left in the Trump administration, added new complications to an already difficult handoff of one of the most ambitious immunization campaign in American history. Azar, joined by other members of the administration at a Tuesday briefing, maintained the vaccination effort is proceeding apace, despite data showing that only a third of distributed doses had been administered. Federal and state officials say there is a lag in reporting.A senior Trump administration official disputed the Biden team criticisms, saying Operation Warp Speed officials looked at the data and studied what states were reporting.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It’s clear in many states that an overly prescriptive focus on the highest priority group was creating a bottleneck and slowing vaccination uptake,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Given soaring cases and deaths, he added, it is critical that every shot be used as quickly as possible, especially in the most vulnerable populations. Ultimately, he said, the decisions will be up to governors.Biden, meanwhile, has insisted the Trump administration is “falling far behind” in immunizing the public, a critical step in allowing Americans to travel, return to work and restore the economy and social fabric. He has set a goal for the country to deliver a first shot to 100 million people within his first 100 days in office. The ambitious target would also require quickly accelerating the pace of immunization.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMembers of Biden’s transition team have been participating in calls with state health officials — organized by the National Governors Association — and have been hearing about states’ need for greater flexibility in spending federal funds and more information about the program run by chain pharmacies in long-term-care facilities, according to state officials who have participated.Vaccines were a chance to redeem failures in the U.S. coronavirus response. What went wrong?While the incoming administration supports states moving as quickly as possible to vaccinate additional priority groups, the transition team has been told by state and local authorities and immunization managers that many states don’t have enough supply of the vaccine or other resources to hire more vaccinators to staff large-scale clinics, the two Biden transition officials said.Biden intends to join his call for accelerating vaccinations with a pitch for more congressional relief aimed at funding the effort, according to people familiar with his plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.Only in the economic stimulus package lawmakers passed at year’s end did they equip states with $8 billion to train additional vaccinators, improve data systems and do outreach to priority populations. But it takes time to get the money out to the states, and health officials say they need more resources to scale up properly.",

        "article": "Please NoteThe Washington Post is providing this important information about the coronavirus for free.  For more free coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter where all stories are free to read.The Trump administration announced sweeping changes to its vaccination rollout on Tuesday, including making all of the coronavirus vaccine supply immediately available, urging states to provide shots to anyone 65 and older and warning states with lagging inoculations that they could lose some of their shots to speedier places.The steps, part of an effort to accelerate a delayed and disjointed rollout, depart from the administration’s original strategy, and come just days after President-elect Joe Biden announced plans to release nearly all the vaccine supply. Biden is expected to provide a detailed blueprint on reinvigorating the rollout later this week, including likely calling for inoculations of everyone 65 and older and expanding the number of venues where shots are administered, according to two people familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them.But it is not clear how, or even if, the outgoing administration’s plan to change state allotments of vaccines will play out. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters in a briefing that in two weeks, the government would begin “redirecting” shots to states based on the size of their 65-and-older population and the pace of their vaccinations. States doing a poor job of getting shots into arms could see their allotments shifted to those performing better, he said, noting that about 10 states might be affected. The current allocation system is based on a state’s population.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFederal officials have complained the data on state immunization efforts is incomplete and that states vary significantly in how many of the shots given to people are reported within the required three days.“This new system gives states a strong incentive to ensure that all vaccinations are being promptly reported, which they’re currently not,” Azar said. “And it gives states a strong incentive to ensure that doses are going to work protecting people rather than sitting on shelves or in freezers.”But Azar, a Trump Cabinet secretary, will be gone in a little over a week, and it is unclear whether the Biden camp endorses the idea. The president-elect’s advisers said they are awaiting more details but would look unfavorably on a plan that “punishes states,” said two transition officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plan. They also expressed concern that the immediate widening of the vaccine pool could overwhelm states and create unrealistic expectations for millions of Americans waiting for shots.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We believe we have to be straight with people about where we are,” said one of the two, a senior transition adviser. “We want states to have the flexibility to move forward, but unfortunately this places an extreme responsibility on states without necessarily giving them the support to execute.”State health officials, meanwhile, denounced the plan to move vaccine from slower-acting states as punitive.“It is too early to begin to judge how well states are administering this, and a punitive approach isn’t going to help us reach our goal of vaccinating the entire population as safely and quickly as possible,” said Michael Fraser, who heads the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.Story continues below advertisementSince the mass vaccination effort began last month, the Trump administration has held back roughly half the vaccines to ensure sufficient supply for people to get a required second shot. Under the new policy, the expectation is that people will still get their second doses about a month later, as planned. Azar and other Operation Warp Speed officials, who oversee vaccine distribution, said concerns about possible hiccups in manufacturing and distribution have been allayed by the steady ramp-up.AdvertisementOver the next two weeks, Azar said, doses held in reserve will be shipped out based on states’ orders. Beyond that, he said, the available doses will be released first to cover second doses and then to provide additional first vaccinations.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) called the move to release all available doses a “welcome change.” “More details will be coming,” he said at a briefing Tuesday. “It is in fact very good news.”Story continues below advertisementOther supporters said that while releasing more vaccines could mean some people might face a small delay in getting a second shot, the risk of delayed inoculations is much greater as the pandemic claims thousands of lives daily and as a new, more contagious variant of the virus first identified in Britain spreads through the United States.Critics, however, worry that an unforeseen and extended delay of the booster shot could undermine the efficacy of the vaccines.AdvertisementBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines — the only two coronavirus vaccines that have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration — were shown in clinical trials this year to be highly effective when administered in a two-shot regimen. The second Pfizer shot is given after 21 days, and the second Moderna shot after 28 days.Story continues below advertisementThe administration’s call to states to broaden access to those 65 and older and those under 64 with high-risk medical conditions sharply increases the potential number of people seeking shots to about 184 million, intensifying demand on already stressed sign-up systems.Under the original CDC recommendations, about 74 million people are in the first priority groups for vaccination: health-care workers; staff and residents of long-term care facilities; front-line essential workers; and adults 75 and older.AdvertisementNeither Azar, nor other Warp Speed leaders, addressed how expanding the priority age groups would affect access to vaccine for front-line essential workers, from grocery store clerks to bus drivers, who had been in the next group prioritized for vaccination in many state plans. Azar noted that some states, such as Florida and Texas, already are vaccinating those 65 and older, and called it a faster way to protect many of the most vulnerable.Story continues below advertisementBut Jason Schwartz, an assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health, said on Twitter that the change could usher in “a free-for-all.”“This seems like chaos,” he added. “Effectively telling 100 million+ people that they are eligible for vaccines now, while knowing that most will have to wait for several months to actually get it” will cause rampant frustration.AdvertisementOthers noted that the priority recommendations from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee were a compromise between the desire to shield front-line essential workers who are disproportionately people of color and most likely to catch and transmit the virus because they cannot work from home, and to protect older people who are most prone to serious complications and death.Story continues below advertisementThe change in the vaccination plans was discussed with governors in a meeting Tuesday afternoon chaired by Vice President Pence. Azar told the group the United States was on track to hit 1 million vaccinations a day within seven to 10 days, according to a Washington state readout.Pfizer, partnering with BioNTech, and Moderna have created promising vaccines that scientists hope will lead to more medical breakthroughs using mRNA. (Joshua Carroll, Brian Monroe/The Washington Post)Catch up on the most important developments in the pandemic with our coronavirus newsletter. All stories in it are free to access.The decisions to overhaul the vaccine distribution program were made this weekend in two meetings held by the leadership of Operation Warp Speed, as officials searched for ways to speed up a sluggish rollout, according to a senior administration official.AdvertisementSome of the changes closely mirror options under consideration by Biden’s covid-19 response team, which is preparing the president-elect to lay out his own pandemic plan later this week. The Biden team was also looking at ways of broadening access for adults 65 and older, and getting states a clearer forecast of future vaccine supply, according to two people familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the specifics.Story continues below advertisementSeveral state health officials and immunization managers complained Tuesday that they got no advance notice of the changes.“I don’t think making allocations more complicated and unpredictable does anything to improve efficiency, or help states get vaccine to where it needs to go,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, whose members direct immunization programs throughout the country.AdvertisementFraser, the head of the state health officials group, added, “The root problem is a supply issue. When will we have 184 million x 2 vaccines?”But Azar blamed the slow rollout on states that have been overly rigid in adhering to the priority list, attempting to inoculate everyone in one group before moving to the next. “There was never a reason that states needed to complete vaccinating all health-care providers before opening vaccinations to older Americans and other vulnerable populations,” he said.He likened it to boarding an airplane. “Imagine if you fined gate agents for boarding people out of order — you’d be standing at the gate for hours.”Nearly 40 million doses are available to states now, Azar said. The latest figures show that more than 27 million doses of the two authorized vaccines have been distributed, with more than 9 million doses administered as of Tuesday at 9 a.m., according to the CDC.Last week, he had announced the federal government was accelerating a plan to distribute vaccines through retail pharmacies, which will handle scheduling appointments and reporting vaccinations. He said officials are also planning to use federally qualified health centers that serve low-income and minority populations.An expansion of vaccination venues is part of Biden’s plan as well. The president-elect said last week that he wants to “establish thousands of federally run and federally supported community vaccination centers of various sizes across the country located in high school gyms or NFL football stadiums.”Biden said the effort will include mobile clinics in rural areas remote from pharmacies, as well as storefront vaccination programs in pharmacies and other commercial spaces. But he cautioned “that will cost money,” saying the Trump administration and Congress have not yet devoted enough effort to the unprecedented mass vacation campaign.",

        "article": "As a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol last week, Eric Foner, one of the nation’s premier Civil War historians, watched in horror.“I was watching just like anyone else, with my mouth hanging open,” he said in an interview.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut his mind quickly shifted to history, specifically the little-known history of a little-known provision of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, is most famously known for providing citizenship and equal protection under the law to anyone born or naturalized in the United States, including formerly enslaved and free Black people.But as calls emerged almost immediately for President Trump’s ouster and ban from office via the 25th Amendment or impeachment — neither course is expeditious or easily accomplished — Foner began pondering a different remedy provided by Section 3 of the amendment, which says:AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.“Nobody really had heard about this except people like me who study this era,” said Foner, a Columbia University professor and author of numerous books on the Civil War, Reconstruction and Abraham Lincoln. “And then I had other historians emailing me saying, ‘Wouldn’t Section 3 apply here if Trump is guilty?’ ”Over the weekend, interest grew in Section 3 beyond the historical realm, with at least one congresswoman broaching the strategy to bar Trump from holding federal office. Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned that the House would move forward with impeaching Trump for a second time if Vice President Pence does not seek to remove him under the 25th Amendment, which Pence declined Tuesday to do. The House could impeach Trump on a charge of “incitement of insurrection\" — a reference to the 14th Amendment — as early as Wednesday, and some Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), said they would support the move.Republicans begin to join impeachment pushOthers want to use the 14th Amendment against members of Congress who supported the baseless allegations that the election was stolen from Trump and the demonstrations that led to the deadly attack on the Capitol.“In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues that invoked the 14th Amendment, “we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both.”This impeached, one-term president refused to go to his successor’s inauguration. Now Trump will do the same.Ending Trump’s presidency under the 14th Amendment is probably impossible, scholars say, because there is no mechanism for removal in the provision. It could, however, be used to prevent Trump or other politicians who supported the attempted insurrection from holding office again.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf Trump is impeached by the House, two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to convict him in a trial that would be held after he leaves office. Using Section 3 of the 14th Amendment wouldn’t require a super majority, historians noted, and wouldn’t complicate the start of Joe Biden’s presidency.Gerard N. Magliocca, an Indiana University law school professor who has studied Section 3, said a majority vote in Congress would express lawmakers’ opinion that Section 3 applies. The courts would then have to make that legal declaration.“It’s not just something that Congress can do,” he said in an interview.The history of Section 3, though little known, is a remarkable one. Though it doesn’t mention them by name, the provision was specifically aimed at Confederates following the Civil War, seeking to bar them from holding public office during Reconstruction.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The language in Section 3 applies to anybody who has made an oath to the Constitution and then violates that oath,” Foner said. “It’s pretty simple.”But the politics around it was not, according to Magliocca, who in a prophetic act of scholarship recently completed a 67-page paper on Section 3, which he calls “one of the vestigial parts of the Constitution.”Southerners deeply opposed the provision, arguing it would harm any effort to unite the country. Though it was ultimately passed, Section 3 was sparsely applied and, as Magliocca put it, “quickly neutered” by Congress just four years later.In 1872, Magliocca wrote, President Ulysses S. Grant and then Congress “concluded that Section Three was not helping Reconstruction and could be making matters worse by giving white Southerners an excuse to aid the Ku Klux Klan,” which the federal government was trying to squash.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith a presidential election looming, Grant told Congress: “More than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired between the armies then arrayed against each other, it may well be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the fourteenth amendment should be removed.” He continued:When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were before the rebellion of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely the same views, but of less standing in their communities.Congress passed the Amnesty Act of 1872, which removed a prohibition against holding office by all but the most senior Confederate leaders. In 1898, wider amnesty was granted as a “gesture of national unity” during the Spanish-American War, Magliocca wrote. (In the 1970s, Congress posthumously granted the same benefits to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy.)Jefferson Davis: The Confederacy’s first, worst and only presidentMagliocca said the amnesty was aimed only at Confederates, not anyone else in the future who might violate the provision.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Those waivers don’t mean that it can’t be applied today,” Magliocca said in an interview.Section 3 has been invoked since the Confederate issue was settled, but just once.In 1919, Congress barred Victor L. Berger, a socialist from Wisconsin, from occupying a House seat following his opposition to the United States entering World War I. A special House committee that took up the issue concluded:that Victor L. Berger, the contestee, because of his disloyalty, is not entitled to the seat to which he was elected, but that in accordance with the unbroken precedents of the House, he should be excluded from membership; and further, that having previously taken an oath as a Member of Congress to support the Constitution of the United States, and having subsequently given aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States during the World War, he is absolutely ineligible to membership in the House of Representatives under section 3 of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.How would Section 3 play out with regard to Trump?Foner and Magliocca aren’t sure.But they suspect the interest in examining the idea to increase rapidly.“I thought of it as soon as people started to use the word ‘insurrection,’ ” Magliocca said.Read more Retropolis:The same nuclear fears Pelosi has about Trump cost an Air Force major his job in 1973The Founders didn’t prepare for a president who refuses to step down, historians sayTrump 2024?

        "article": "One way or another, Donald Trump will soon be gone from the White House. And that, to quote Prince Hamlet, is “a consummation devoutly to be wished.”As the remaining moments dwindle, I find myself thinking back to Nov. 8, 2016. Unlike this past election night, I was able then to be with my colleagues in The Post’s newsroom, where in the late afternoon, I had sauntered in, confident enough in a history-making Hillary Clinton victory that I had already written the start of a column about it.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightA few hours later, I was scrambling, like almost everyone else. Hands shaking, I managed to write a column condemning the media’s epic failure leading up to the election; after it went online, the word filtered down from the boss, Executive Editor Martin Baron, that I should write a second one about how the press must cover Trump in the months and years ahead.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat column wasn’t especially coherent or polished, but in it I conveyed a couple of decent ideas. One was that we must meet the moment: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” The other, something I’ve often reflected on, was the closing line — the kicker, as we journalists call it. I concluded that the press would not be able to avert disaster by itself: “We’re going to need some heroes.”I’m still not quite sure what I meant. As I said, my hands were shaking. But it resonates for me anyway.From 2016: A call to action for journalists covering President TrumpSomething else from that night comes to mind. After deadline (or maybe between deadlines), reporters and editors stood around, trying to process Trump’s shocking win. One young Black editor had tears in her eyes, not saying much but clearly aware — rightly so — that Trump’s ascendancy was an existential threat, not just to her but to something much larger. She understood, at a visceral and an intellectual level, that a misogynist con artist who sympathized with white supremacists was about to do a whole lot of damage.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAn older staffer (White, male and a former foreign correspondent) tried to counter her reaction by offering a bit of perspective — predicting, also rightly, that we were all about to have what every journalist yearns for: a “great story” to cover.Now we know how it has played out. Now we know how we did.We know whether tears were more appropriate than journalistic enthusiasm. We know whether our spines were stiff enough, and whether some heroes came along to help  in pulling democracy back from the brink.Since last week’s outrageous and deadly attack on the Capitol, incited by Trump, the gloves have come off. The language that journalists feel free to use is far more direct, far less mired in cautious respect for the highest office in the land.Story continues below advertisementAs Roy Peter Clark wrote a few days ago, in a dissection of a front-page Washington Post report that used words like “saboteurs” and “attempted coup” to describe the MAGA marauders: “I am astonished . . . by an epiphany: Language that pushes the boundaries of traditional neutrality can be used in a responsible news report.”AdvertisementAmong mainstream news organizations, The Post has done as well as or better than any other in reporting the Trump story directly, skillfully and well. And many others have risen admirably to the challenge: the New York Times with its revelations about Trump’s finances; Vice News with its 2017 documentary on the white supremacists whom Trump would not convincingly condemn as they marched in Charlottesville; ProPublica with its audio recording of sobbing children at a Texas facility run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection where immigrant children — taken from their parents because of the administration’s inhumane policies — were housed.I mentioned this reporting and other excellent work in an analysis in November just after Joe Biden defeated Trump, concluding that while the press fell dismayingly short in myriad ways, it was essential in giving democracy a chance to survive.Story continues below advertisementAnd non-journalistic heroes did emerge — the kind I was hoping for. Those who shored up our teetering republic were American patriots guided by a moral compass and a commitment to the truth, not by party loyalty or cynical careerism. A few names among many: Marie Yovanovitch, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Christopher Krebs, Stacey Abrams, Mitt Romney, Anthony S. Fauci, the late Elijah E. Cummings, the late John Lewis, Emmet Sullivan (and other judges who stuck to facts and law). And thousands of election officials of both parties who worked resolutely, often under threat.AdvertisementTrump leaves the nation in tatters and disgraced on the world stage. Because of his bungled response, more than 375,000 Americans have died of covid-19, and the pandemic — “it’s going to disappear,” he lied again in October — rages on.What’s happened in the journalism sphere is complicated. Tragically, crucial sources of local news have withered, while the toxic media of the radical right thrives, even as Trump rewards one of its bigwigs, Rush Limbaugh, with a tainted Medal of Freedom.Story continues below advertisementThe reality-based national press, though flawed and stuck for too long in outdated conventions, has managed to do its job — with dedication and with bravery, given the dangers created by Trump’s antipathy to what he calls “the enemy of the people.”And that is a damn good thing because, without that digging and that truth-telling, we would be utterly lost.AdvertisementIn the wee hours of Nov. 9, 2016, I made the brief walk home, from the Post newsroom to my apartment, only a mile from the Capitol.That couldn’t happen now. These days, because of covid, our newsroom has been empty for 10 months. And I would be more apprehensive now about stepping out into the darkness.Story continues below advertisementYes, quite a memorable story we’ve covered.As for my colleague’s tears?

Another man wearing a sweatshirt reading — God help us, find out what company makes this and shut it down — “Camp Auschwitz.”And, Zip Tie Guy.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhich brings us to Eric Munchel.In one of the more terrifying images of last week, a man believed to be Munchel, wearing dark fatigues and a face-obscuring black gaiter, climbed over a railing in the Senate Gallery. He wore a Taser holstered to his hip and gripped a bunch of zip-tie handcuffs in one hand. While his fellow raiders were busy “scratching their balls” in Nancy Pelosi’s office or literally pooping on the Capitol’s floors, Zip Tie Guy had the mien of someone who had breached the complex with an actual nefarious plan involving hostages or worse.The man suspected of being Zip Tie Guy was unmasked over the weekend by the Internet, then arrested by the FBI: Munchel, 30, has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. On Sunday, the FBI released more images, allegedly of Munchel, that had been captured throughout the day of Jan. 6.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn several, he was accompanied by a graying 57-year-old woman. And this is the point at which the portrait of Munchel became fuller, because this is the point at which it became a working theory that Zip Tie Guy had brought his mom to the revolution.In a security camera image from earlier that afternoon, a pair of tourists, believed to be Munchel and mom, left their Hyatt hotel with matching cups of coffee in hand as if setting off for a long day at the Smithsonian. In a cellphone clip a few hours later, he ushers her up the stairs inside the Capitol, one hand steering her shoulder as they went about their illegal siege.Some Trump allies have speculated that antifa was responsible for inciting violence and storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. No evidence supports this claim. (The Washington Post)Truly, this is a testament to either a mother-son bond or a shared appetite for militant insurrection (They appear to share views: The alleged woman in question, Lisa Eisenhart, told the Times of London, “The left has everything: the media, organizations, the government. We have to organize if we’re going to fight back and be heard.”)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementYou have to wonder: If Zip Tie Guy and Munchel are indeed the same person, as the FBI alleges, where did he stash her while he was off climbing railings as part of whatever mission he’d assigned himself? Perhaps even the most devoted sons must eventually leave their mothers to commit the traditional coming-of-age ritual of trashing the seat of American Democracy in the name of being a patriot.From Tennessee news sources — Munchel is from Nashville — we learned other biographical details about the suspect: He previously worked at Kid Rock’s Big Ass Honky Tonk & Rock ’n’ Roll Steakhouse until he was fired a few months ago; he worked at another bar before that. He has deleted his Facebook page, but if you’d gone there early last week you could have seen a photo of him, brandishing an American flag and a shotgun, mouth wide open as if caught mid-yawp, standing in front of a TV tray and a flat-screen filled with President Trump’s face.Arrests and charges of the Capitol rioters will continue this week. And the more we learn about the would-be usurpers, the more they become both horrifying and ridiculous. The QAnon Shaman, a.k.a.

Council on the potential dangers posed to residents as thousands of President Trump’s most ardent supporters descended on the city.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightD.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine’s office then circulated a memo to lawmakers —  first reported by BuzzFeed — making clear that District code allows the U.S. president to seize control of the local police force. The president can also deputize National Guard members and U.S. marshals in the city, or invoke the Insurrection Act to bring armed troops to the District to “suppress a rebellion.”Council members feared a repeat of Dec. 12 — when hordes of demonstrators poured into downtown, clashing violently with counterprotesters and targeting Black Lives Matter signs at churches. They worried Trump would use any new unrest to seize control of local law enforcement — as he threatened to do over the summer, amid demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

But with President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration looming next week, and far-right groups promising to return, the council is again seeking clarity on plans to protect D.C. and its residents, and to ensure that local law enforcement agencies, rather than their federal counterparts, keep control of city streets.“I’ve got deep concerns about the coordination and preparation between several law enforcement officials and others who are charged with the keeping people safe through and during the inauguration,” said Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5).Trump administration considered taking control of D.C. police force to quell protestsHe and other lawmakers said they are especially disturbed that Trump egged on the demonstrators at a rally outside the White House before they headed to the Capitol.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Law enforcement — local and federal — should be coordinating with the understanding President Trump and his far-right conspiracy influence fanatics are a threat to local District of Columbia, the Capitol, national security and democracy,” McDuffie said.Fears of unrest downtown last week prompted the council to issue a statement urging residents not to engage with those who were traveling to the city to protest on Wednesday.“The Dec. 12 demonstrations got out of hand, and we were hearing tenuous tips that [Jan. 6] would be worse . . . white supremacists looking for African Americans to beat up, or some of the militia groups going over to Black Lives Matter Plaza and looking for trouble and confrontation,” said Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). “And that it would then, in turn, provoke the president to threaten to do what he threatened to do back in June, which was take over the police.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe chairman added: “I can assure you, nobody was thinking about storming the Capitol.”In coming days, more potential violence is expected. The FBI recently issued a memo to law enforcement agencies that armed protests are being planned at state capitols across the country, as well as the District, leading up to the inauguration. On far-right online forums, calls to action have included discussions about how to skirt the city’s strict weapons laws. In an unprecedented move, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on Monday asked Americans not to visit the District on Jan. 20, telling them to participate in Biden’s inauguration virtually.The Capitol Siege was planned online. Trump supporters are now planning the next one.Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), said he and other council members are still seeking more specifics on the government’s plan to protect federal sites and monuments after last week’s security collapse. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) said she has received emails and calls from residents asking how they can remain safe should those seeking to cause harm decide to venture into other parts of the city.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We’ve been told we have help from the surrounding jurisdictions with their law enforcement. We have our own MPD. We have federal forces, we have the National Guard — it ought to be enough,” Cheh said. “I don’t know what more we could supplement them with.”To mitigate further turmoil in the city, then-acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said Monday that emergency measures for the inauguration would take effect Wednesday, six days earlier than planned. Bowser extended indoor dining and museum closures and asked Wolf to prohibit any permits for demonstrations from Monday until Jan. 24, but officials have not yet responded to that request. The National Guard said it plans to deploy as many as 15,000 members during the inauguration, compared with the 340 members who were initially activated ahead of Wednesday’s riot.“As somebody who lives five blocks away [from the Capitol] and represents the neighbors around it, we are concerned about what planning and preparations are also taking place for outside the fence,” said Allen, who initiated last week’s briefing with Racine (D), acting police chief Robert J. Contee III and Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency Director Chris Rodriguez.“The more clarity and planning and preparation we have on the federal side, the more that allows us on the local side to plan appropriately.”\n",

But what I saw was a lot of people who were committed to reform. And they were committed to electoral reform.”In a call on Jan. 12 with United States Agency for International Development staff, Tim Meisburger, the outgoing deputy assistant administrator for the agency,  told employees the Capitol riot was the work of “a few violent people.” (The Washington Post)A USAID spokeswoman declined to comment. The Washington Post obtained two different recordings of the same meeting, where Meisburger made the comments. When The Post reached Meisburger by phone for comment, Meisburger declined to comment, then hung up, and did not respond to subsequent text messages.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThere were not several million people protesting at the Capitol last Wednesday, nor at an earlier rally at the Ellipse, near the White House. Organizers had expected up to 30,000 people to attend the rally.Also, multiple videos of the incident contradict the description Meisburger gave of the riots, showing scores of people pushed their way into the capitol, attacking several police officers, including one who was beaten with a flagpole.

Never!!!”Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump’s failure to act after a mob stormed the CapitolMeisburger works within the Bureau for Development, Democracy and Innovation at the Center for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance, according to USAID’s website. The website also reports he began his career in international development as a Peace Corps volunteer in Lesotho in 1988 and has worked as a specialist in elections and democratization since 1992.AdvertisementSeveral current and former USAID officials pointed out what they saw as the hypocrisy of Meisburger’s comments, given his role as a democracy specialist.Story continues below advertisementSteven Feldstein, a former USAID and State Department official who served during the Bush and Obama administrations, said Meisburger’s comments were shocking for their “tone deafness.”“How can U.S. government democracy assistance officials continue to promote peaceful, legitimate and fair elections around the world, while at the same time offering suggestions that the U.S. elections themselves and the violent aftermath are an acceptable conclusion to our electoral process?” asked Feldstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank.One official on the call pushed back on Meisburger’s comments, noting her husband was at the Capitol during the riots. “It was a lot of people, it was enough people to actually break into the Capitol,” said the woman, according to an audio recording of the video chat.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementShe also pushed back on the idea that “perception” of a supposedly fraudulent election was enough to call the results into question, referring to efforts before the election to sow doubt in the results due to the greater use of mail-in ballots.Meisburger replied he was “not going to get into a debate with anyone today.”Another employee then asked Meisburger if he himself was at the Capitol with the rioters, but was told Meisburger was no longer on the call.

        "article": "As President-elect Joe Biden continues building his team, there is one critical job for which he doesn’t need to make a change.Even though it would mean extending the tenure of a Trump political appointee, Biden should keep current Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens on board. Doing so would send a powerful message to the families of Americans currently being held abroad and their captors that the U.S. government is always committed to the safe return of Americans wrongfully or arbitrarily detained.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt’s admirable that Biden wants to work with his political adversaries in the Republican Party. But after their wretched behavior since the election, the leaders of the Republican Party don’t deserve an olive branch from the incoming administration. Biden is right, though, that the United States will require bipartisan cooperation to thrive again. The trick is finding issues that reach past the petty politics of division. Hostage recovery might be the clearest example of that, and continuity in policy is critical, both in the mission to ensure hostages return home and in caring for their fragile families.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAccording to recent data published the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, a leading hostage and press freedom advocacy group, there are currently at least 43 American citizens being held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. Some of them are well-known cases, including Post contributor Austin Tice in Syria; Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed in Russia; U.K.-born dual national Morad Tahbaz, Siamak Namazi and Baquer Namazi in Iran; Mark Frerichs in Afghanistan; and the so-called Citgo 6, six executives of the oil giant being held in Venezuela.Others are not so high-profile, but no less tragic.President Barack Obama started this position to address the growing problem of Americans being taken hostage abroad. Previous efforts to win the release of hostages were often complicated by a lack of interagency cooperation, and the envoy helped streamline the process. President Trump, to his credit, has used the office effectively to free several Americans.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA smooth transition between administrations is vital to avoid derailing progress in the efforts to release hostages that are already underway. Since assuming his position last March, Carstens has prioritized infrastructure in the hostage recovery process that will ensure there are never gaps in the event of changes in staff. He should be given the opportunity to see it through.Across multiple conversations, Carstens has told me that “every day an American is being held hostage abroad means I have failed to accomplish my mission.” As a former hostage, and someone who regularly communicates with the families of current hostages, I think this is precisely the attitude you want from your main advocate in government.Several family members I spoke with whose loved ones are being held hostage feel strongly that Carstens should stay, as do diplomats of key U.S. allies and the heads of several nongovernmental organizations working on hostage issues.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This responsibility is so important that you can’t just look at a candidate’s credentials alone. This takes a particular personality and type of dedication. When someone is doing the job so well, replacing them would be crazy,” said Elizabeth Whelan, whose brother Paul has been held in Russia for more than two years.Whelan and other families spoke about Carstens’s proactive commitment to each case; he regularly checks in with relatives by phone to provide updates and to show that someone in the U.S. government cares and is fighting for them. The importance of this can’t be overstated. But that’s not to say that Carstens is simply playing the role of social worker.“I consider Roger a bit of a cowboy, and I mean that in a positive way. He’s not a suit,” Whelan said. “He’s capable of working in that bureaucratic environment, but he’s on a mission to get all these guys home. These people have real meaning to him. They aren’t just pieces of paper in a folder.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThis job requires someone who is willing to engage with adversaries, travel to dangerous places if necessary, and provide support to families and returning hostages as they try to navigate the complexities of government bureaucracy. Carstens has this rare combination of attributes, and Biden should put those skills to good use.After graduating from the U.S. Military Academy, Carstens joined the Army’s Special Forces — the Green Berets — where he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He then worked for an NGO that delivered humanitarian aid from Jordan into southern Syria. His first job in the Trump administration was deputy assistant secretary at the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor in the State Department.He also has a master’s degree from St. John’s College in Annapolis, where he studied the “great books,” as he put it.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The books I read at St. John’s reminded me, though, of my responsibility to help bring others to their freedom,” Carstens once told me.If Biden is looking for an issue around which he can build a bipartisan bridge, I can think of none more appropriate than working together for the safe return of Americans held hostage abroad. Carstens is the right sort of mission-driven public servant to lead the effort.Countless initiatives are disrupted by the transition from one administration to the next. But with the lives of fellow Americans at stake, politics should not interfere with a job well done.Read more:Jackson Diehl: Trump has pressed hostile regimes to release American prisoners.

Jim Jordan (Ohio), a captain of the Republican attempt to overturn the election, defended the months-long effort, which culminated in last week’s deadly riot at the Capitol.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightHouse Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) pleaded with his colleague to cut it out. “There are still serious concerns about another attack here in Washington, D.C., and in every corner of this country because of the lies that the election was stolen,” McGovern cautioned, noting FBI warnings about armed protests planned for Sunday at all 50 state capitols.“For the sake of the country, it would be helpful if you would simply state for the record that this election was not stolen,\" he urged Jordan. “Those five words, I think, will go a long way to dissuading some of these people.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThose five words were too much for Jordan. “Now, you have to say exactly what the left wants,” he complained. As for the election, Jordan added, “I never once said it was stolen.”No? Right after the election, Jordan stood on the steps of the state Capitol in Harrisburg, Pa., at a “Stop the Steal” rally, surrounded by “Stop the Steal” signs and greeted by chants of “Stop the Steal.” He shouted into a bullhorn that “our elections should have integrity.”Later, he alleged, “President Trump got 11 million more votes than he did in 2016 … but somehow the guy who never left his house wins the election?” He added that “60 million Americans think it was stolen.”Story continues below advertisementTwo days before the riot, he was on Newsmax complaining about “the fraud” and “the unconstitutional fashion in which these elections were held.” Jordan said, “It’s time for us to fight.”AdvertisementOn the day of the insurrection, he claimed Democrats “did an end-run around the Constitution.”In Trump’s infamous speech last week, the president thanked Jordan by name for “fighting the House.” On Monday, he repaid Jordan by giving him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honorYet now, after a MAGA mob sacked the Capitol, leaving five dead, Jordan claims he said nothing about the election being stolen?People like Jordan are why the effort to impeach Trump, which the House takes up Wednesday, is both imperative and insufficient.Story continues below advertisementCertainly, Trump deserves to be impeached for inciting an insurrection; lawmakers, direct targets of the attack, have ample justification for doing so. If Trump had any integrity, he would resign. If Vice President Pence had integrity, he would invoke the 25th Amendment. If Republican congressional leaders had integrity, they would see to Trump’s removal before he can do more harm. On Tuesday, an unrepentant Trump said his riot-inciting speech was “totally appropriate\" — as if any more grounds were needed to justify his ouster.AdvertisementEven if Trump were removed in his final week, though, the punishment would be inadequate, because it lets his co-conspirators off the hook. The attack on the Capitol was not a protest but a crime.

That Senate trial would be unconstitutional.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightOn Sunday, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said that, while House Democrats would take up articles of impeachment this week against President Trump, the House might delay sending to the Senate any articles passed by the House until after President-elect Biden’s first 100 days in office. Biden proposed an alternative, under which the new Senate would immediately begin working on his legislative agenda and confirming his Cabinet appointments in the mornings and conduct the impeachment trial in the afternoon.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe sequencing of the House impeachment proceedings before Trump’s departure from office and the inauguration of the new president, followed by a Senate impeachment trial, perhaps months later, raises the question of whether a former president can be impeached after he leaves office.The Constitution itself answers this question clearly: No, he cannot be. Once Trump’s term ends on Jan. 20, Congress loses its constitutional authority to continue impeachment proceedings against him — even if the House has already approved articles of impeachment.Therefore, if the House of Representatives were to impeach the president before he leaves office, the Senate could not thereafter convict the former president and disqualify him under the Constitution from future public office.Story continues below advertisementThe reason for this is found in the Constitution itself. Trump would no longer be incumbent in the Office of the President at the time of the delayed Senate proceeding and would no longer be subject to “impeachment conviction” by the Senate, under the Constitution’s Impeachment Clauses. Which is to say that the Senate’s only power under the Constitution is to convict — or not — an incumbent president.AdvertisementThe purpose, text and structure of the Constitution’s Impeachment Clauses confirm this intuitive and common-sense understanding.The very concept of constitutional impeachment presupposes the impeachment, conviction and removal of a president who is, at the time of his impeachment, an incumbent in the office from which he is removed. Indeed, that was the purpose of the impeachment power, to remove from office a president or other “civil official” before he could further harm the nation from the office he then occupies.Story continues below advertisementThe plain text of the Constitution’s several Impeachment Clauses confirms this understanding of this limit on Congress’ impeachment power. For example, Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution reads, “The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” In the same constitutional vein, Article I, Section 3 provides in relevant part: “Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”AdvertisementIt has been suggested that the Senate could proceed to try the former president and convict him in an effort to disqualify him from holding public office in the future. This is incorrect because it is a constitutional impeachment of a president that authorizes his constitutional disqualification. If a president has not been constitutionally impeached, then the Senate is without the constitutional power to disqualify him from future office.Some constitutional scholars take support for their view that the Congress can impeach a former president from two instances in which early Congresses impeached “civil officials” after they had resigned their public offices — the impeachments of Sen. William Blount in 1797 and the impeachment of Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876.Story continues below advertisementThese congressional impeachment cases provide some backing for the argument that Congress can conclude that it has the power under the Constitution to impeach a former president. And Congress’s understanding of its constitutional powers would be a weighty consideration in the ultimate determination whether the Congress does possess such authority. When and if the former president goes to court to challenge his impeachment trial as unconstitutional, Congress is sure to make its argument based on these congressional precedents, as well as others, a case that would almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court.AdvertisementIn the end, though, only the Supreme Court can answer the question of whether Congress can impeach a president who has left office prior to its attempted impeachment of him. It is highly unlikely the Supreme Court would yield to Congress’s view that it has the power to impeach a president who is no longer in office when the Constitution itself is so clear that it does not.Early on Jan. 6, The Post's Kate Woodsome saw signs of violence hours before thousands of former president Donald Trump loyalists besieged the Capitol.

        "article": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is, once again, playing politics with impeachment. On CBS News’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, she warned that President Trump has to be removed because he poses an imminent threat to the country. We have a “deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the United States, and we’re only a number of days until we can be protected from him,” Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightWell, if Trump is that dangerous, why didn’t she call the House back immediately to pass articles of impeachment, and then challenge the Senate to come back into session and hold a trial this week? Instead, she is waiting until Wednesday — a full week after the Capitol riot — to hold a House vote. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) suggested this weekend that Pelosi could wait until well into the Biden presidency before sending impeachment articles to the Senate. “Let’s give President-elect [Joe] Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,” Clyburn said. “And maybe we will send the articles sometime after that.”Pelosi is politicizing what are very serious and weighty questions: Did the president of the United States engage in impeachable conduct? And is it prudent to impeach him when the Constitution will remove him from office in a matter of days?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn the first question, the answer is clearly yes. It is true that, as some legal scholars have pointed out, Trump would never be convicted of incitement in a criminal court. As former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who successfully prosecuted “blind sheikh” Omar Abdel Rahman for incitement, told me, “an incitement case is very difficult in criminal court. ... You have to intend that a violent crime take place.” McCarthy points out, however, that the issue in impeachment is not criminal liability, but whether the president committed what Alexander Hamilton described as political offenses that call into question his fitness for office. And by that standard, McCarthy says, what Trump did was “clearly an impeachable offense” and “a deep betrayal of his obligations as president … to protect our elections, rather than undermine them, and to protect Congress.”For more than six weeks, Trump ginned up anger among his supporters, telling them they had reelected him in a landslide and that their victory was being stolen from them. He then brought a massive crowd to Washington on the day that Congress was meeting to confirm Biden’s electoral college victory, and urged them to march on the Capitol. He might not have intended for his supporters to storm the building, but he recklessly stoked a throng of people who did just that — and five deaths occurred.Instead of immediately rushing to the cameras to call off his supporters, Trump sat back and watched them ransack the Capitol. An hour after they had overwhelmed police barricades, Trump poured gasoline on the fire, tweeting “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country.” (Indeed, Trump never even bothered to call to see whether the vice president was safe.) Only at 2:38 p.m. did Trump feebly tweet urging the already violent mob to “Stay peaceful!” It was not until 4:17 p.m. — nearly three hours into the assault — that Trump finally posted a video telling his supporters “you have to go home now.” Even then, he spent more time claiming his “landslide” election was “stolen” than calling for calm.Early on Jan. 6, The Post's Kate Woodsome saw signs of violence hours before thousands of former president Donald Trump loyalists besieged the Capitol. (The Washington Post)And while Trump might not have intended to provoke violence, he intended to send a crowd to coerce Pence into committing an unconstitutional act by invalidating electoral votes cast for Biden. That is an abuse of power. Trump told the crowd that “all Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president.” They swarmed into the Capitol chanting “Hang Mike Pence” when he refused. Trump played with matches and started a forest fire — that makes him culpable for the death and destruction that ensued, even if he didn’t intend to set the fire.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe second question is more difficult. If Trump had nine months left in office, rather than nine days, there is no doubt that he should be removed from office. It is unclear, however, whether at this late date, an impeachment trial is in the country’s best interests. It would divide the country, turn Trump into a martyr, and keep him front and center for months into Biden’s term. There is also the risk that he might be acquitted, because some Republicans might decide they cannot convict a president who has already left office, while others fear alienating constituents who just voted to give Trump a second term. Trump could then claim vindication. The best thing might be to let him simply leave in ignominy. But Pelosi seems to care more about politics and retribution than what is best for the country.Read more:Jonathan Capehart: Laurence Tribe says Trump should be impeached again — even if a Senate conviction is unlikelyAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHillary Clinton: Trump should be impeached.

        "article": "Alarming new details are emerging about the true nature of the violent insurrection that we witnessed last week — and the critical point about this insurrection is that it is ongoing.This raises the stakes on what we’re seeing from many Republicans, who are working to obscure the true source of this ongoing threat. By piously calling for “unity,” and claiming impeachment will “divide” us, they are striving to manufacture the impression that the cause of our ongoing breakdown is some species of generalized division.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn fact, it’s a straight cause-and-effect: One side (Trump and his democracy-despising enablers who are still trying to illegitimately overturn the election’s outcome) is threatening and inciting violence against the other (those who stand for constitutional democracy and are affirming the legitimacy of that outcome).AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThis has now been crystallized by none other than a senior Republican congressional staffer. Politico reports that Jason Schmid has resigned from the House Foreign Affairs Committee with a blistering letter attacking his party’s efforts to overturn the election.Schmid argued in his letter that Republicans had failed to sufficiently condemn the insurrection. I want to highlight this:The sad, incontrovertible truth is that the people who laid siege to the Capitol were and continue to be domestic enemies of the Constitution of the United States. A poisonous lie that the election was illegitimate and should be overturned inspired so called “patriots” to share common cause with white supremacists, neo-Nazis and conspiracy theorists to attack the seat of American government.GOP lawmakers who voted to overturn the election, Schmid charged, “harmed the ability of every service member, intelligence officer, and diplomat to defend the nation and advance American interests.”What’s important here is the unflinching acknowledgment of two things: First, the claim by Trump and his enablers that he won is a deranged lie and anyone telling it is an enemy of U.S. constitutional democracy. Second, this lie is what incited the violent siege of the Capitol.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat is what many Republicans will not say, and it’s why this letter is important news. Different Republicans are at different places on this spectrum of denial. For instance, while just about all will condemn the violence, some are still refusing to admit either that Joe Biden legitimately won the election or that Trump’s lies are the primary source of the violence.Meanwhile, others will admit Biden won but still refuse to forthrightly admit to the threat that Trump’s lies pose. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) sort of admits Trump might have caused the violence, but to do so, he hides behind the claim that Trump himself privately admitted to this, which is highly implausible.And Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.) concedes Biden’s victory but claims that impeachment could “incite further violence.” That has menacing hints — hold Trump accountable for inciting violence and you’ll meet more violence! — but more to the point, it’s straight-up obfuscation of the actual threat, which comes from Trump’s incitement.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump is enforcing this line among Republicans. He told reporters on Tuesday that “I want no violence” and that Democrats pursuing impeachment are “causing tremendous anger.”There’s that veiled threat again — Hold me accountable for inciting violence and you’ll meet more violence! — but it’s also a command to Republicans: Keep denying that I’m the chief instigator of the violence, and keep claiming the real threat of incitement comes from Democrats.All this comes as the threat is starting to look even more dire. The Post reports that the day before the assault, an FBI office in Virginia warned that hordes were heading to Washington to wage “war”:Story continues below advertisementA situational information report approved for release the day before the U.S. Capitol riot painted a dire portrait of dangerous plans, including individuals sharing a map of the complex’s tunnels, and possible rally points for would-be conspirators to meet up in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and South Carolina and head in groups to Washington.Meanwhile, The Post’s report notes, federal agents are “in a state of high-alert” about possible violence at Biden’s inauguration. And the FBI has warned in another memo that “armed protests” are planned “at all 50 state capitols.”AdvertisementTrump’s lies about the election, echoed by his enablers, are the cause of this threat. And a great many Republicans simply refuse to say this.Making this worse, as Simon Rosenberg points out, countless elected GOP officials are already on record having propped up these lies for months. The only way to reverse this is to flatly and unequivocally declare that those were lies and that Biden legitimately won:I would add that Republicans must also say unequivocally that this lie caused last week’s violence, and that it threatens untold more to come.Story continues below advertisementRepublican calls for “unity” are conditional: Unity can only be premised on a blanket agreement not to acknowledge the truth about who and what are actually to blame for violently tearing the country in half. Until Republicans tell the truth about all of this, their professed hopes for unity are empty nonsense, to be treated with derisive contempt.AdvertisementRead more:The Post’s View: Law enforcement failed on Jan. 6.

American Airlines, AT&T, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Ford — the list goes on. They’re all hitting pause on the giving, or restricting gifts to the complicit. Even Deutsche Bank, Trump’s primary lender for two decades, is saying auf wiedersehen.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe post-presidency has been a lucrative gig ever since Gerald Ford started traveling what Ronald Reagan called the “mashed-potato circuit” — even without the hefty annual pension afforded former commanders in chief. Jimmy Carter, eating salmon and broccoli casserole on a paper plate while sipping on bargain-brand chardonnay, was never the norm. Bill Clinton has racked up tens of millions of dollars in speeches. George W. Bush declared upon leaving the Oval Office that he intended to “replenish the ol’ coffers.” Barack Obama has leaned into branding, hard. Book deals are old news; the hot game now is Netflix and Spotify production deals.Trump, by contrast, was always trying to make money when he was still in office, telling Fortune that he might be the first hopeful to come out of his run richer than when he entered it. This boast turned out also to be a bluff; the reality TV star by all accounts is poorer now than he was four years ago, despite pouring taxpayer money into Mar-a-Lago by hosting summits there or hoovering up the dollars of diplomats at some of his other properties. (The so-called winter White House did manage to double its initiation fee, turning into the go-to destination for glitzy, glamorous GOP events. “Where big donors go to see and be seen,” as The Post put it. )Today, it seems no one wants to be seen next to Trump.

Meadows’s staff had prompted him to go see the president, with one aide telling the chief of staff before he entered the Oval Office, ‘They are going to kill people.’ ” And here is the kicker:AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPress officials had begun discussing a statement from Trump around 2 p.m., when protesters first breached the Capitol, an official familiar with the discussions said. But they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the president and could only take the matter to Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, this person said, adding that “the most infuriating part” of the day was how long it took before Trump finally spoke out.Aside from the inexcusable refusal of Meadows to step in, what is striking is that the president refused to be diverted from watching television images of the mob he incited. He delayed in trying to protect the Capitol. He then sent two separate and halfhearted messages telling them “to remain peaceful.”Hours after the assault began, he issued a sympathetic message: “This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. ... We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special. You’ve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home, and go home in peace.” The message was as much incitement and praise as it was a plea for his supporters to go home. He still was incapable of defending the Capitol.He still cannot. Pence reportedly talked to Trump on Monday and now appears to be willing to let Trump finish his term. However, Trump is incapable of doing this without further incitement. On his trip to the border Tuesday, he warned Congress not to impeach him: \"I think it’s causing tremendous anger.” What is that but a backhanded way of telling lawmakers that his mob will rise up again if they try to remove him?

        "article": "In the second debate between Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden this past October, the president claimed Wall Street investors would prefer he receive a second term. If Biden emerged with the White House prize, Trump claimed, “the stock market will crash.”Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat’s not exactly what happened.Since the election, the stock market has surged upward. The Dow Jones industrial average increased by nearly 12 percent in November, the largest one-month gain in more than 30 years. Even as violent insurrectionists surged throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, the Dow increased by more than 400 points. It has crossed the 30,000 mark and set record after record, including another record close the day Trump finally conceded to Biden.Story continues below advertisementWe can name all sorts of reasons. The holiday retail season was not as bad as feared. Investors tend to be forward-looking, and the debut of multiple coronavirus vaccines points toward an end of the surging pandemic and a return to a more normal life. And many of the market-share gains made by big-business during the pandemic — particularly in e-commerce — are likely permanent.AdvertisementBut most important: Biden will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, and he will do so with Democratic control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The nation is moving on.And it appears that investors are not unhappy with the new reality. Concerns about increased Washington regulation and the possibility of higher taxes on the wealthy are canceled out by the likelihood of further economic relief for people and businesses suffering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. As a paper released by UBS Global Wealth Management puts it, “On balance, Biden’s policies are likely to add stimulus to the economy.”Story continues below advertisementNo doubt, Trump is taking this personally. He repeatedly — and ridiculously — gave himself credit for the market’s strong performance during his time in office, while almost always going silent when it went down. “Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent,” he said in his last State of the Union address. He was not exactly subtle. “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,” he once said, adding that his business smarts and policies such as tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, along with a wrecking-ball approach to regulation in areas ranging from the environment to consumer safety, caused the gains.AdvertisementBut as it turns out, these are not the only things that excite investors. These people are not, as Trump would have you believe, enthused only by unnecessary tax cuts and an anti-regulatory agenda. Businesses and investors also value stability — and Trump offered anything but. One moment he was threatening China with a trade war, the next he was best buds with Chinese president Xi Jinping. He claimed he wanted Americans to receive another round of stimulus checks but did nothing to actually make it happen. He attempted to browbeat Jerome H. Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve.One never knew where one stood with Trump, except to know that if something benefited his own bottom line, he tried to make it happen. (One tax policy expert said in 2017 that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act so benefitted Trump, “The Republican tax bill looks like it was written by Donald Trump’s accountants and lawyers and I’m not even joking.”) That investors saw Trump’s actions as a positive for them was almost certainly a secondary concern to the president.Story continues below advertisementPredicting the future of the stock market is a fool’s game. The same is true for interpreting why it makes the moves — either up or down — it does. But I must admit to a moment of personal satisfaction. In the same way that Trump is seeing the CEOs who once sucked up to him now racing to condemn his presidency, he’s also learning — with every upward tick of the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 — that the stock market was not only not his friend but that it will prosper just fine without him.Early on Jan. 6, The Post's Kate Woodsome saw signs of violence hours before thousands of former president Donald Trump loyalists besieged the Capitol.

Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), who at 1:42 p.m. Wednesday stood on the floor and announced: “There is no excuse for President Trump’s actions. . . . With a heavy heart and clear resolve, I will vote yes on these articles of impeachment.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLess than five minutes later, another Republican from Washington, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, rose to declare that she, too, would vote to impeach. “I’m not afraid of losing my job, but I am afraid that my country will fail,” she said.In the Oval Office, Trump must have feared a stampede. Within minutes, the White House issued a statement from the president: “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence.” Trump’s chief defender, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), quickly read it aloud in the chamber.If only Republicans had spoken up earlier. If only, even now, more Republicans could overcome their fear of Trump and denounce him for inciting insurrection, they could rid the party of this cancer.Story continues below advertisementAfter greenlighting his every assault on democratic norms, many Republicans amplified his attempts to overturn the election results by perpetuating the lie that the election was stolen. It culminated in last week’s bloodshed and mayhem in the Capitol.AdvertisementNow, our nation’s capital is under siege by the MAGA mob.  Approximately 2,000 National Guard troops bivouacked in the halls of Congress before Wednesday’s impeachment debate, the first such deployment since the Civil War and part of a force of 20,000 coming to defend the capital from attack by pro-Trump rioters.Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) kicked off the impeachment debate for Republicans by asking “for God’s blessing and protection . . . for all who come to this chamber.” He had to cut debate short because speakers were delayed navigating through the fortress. “They’re just having a hard time getting here,” he said.Story continues below advertisementRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a veteran, observed that “there are more troops right now in Washington, D.C., than in Afghanistan, and they are here to defend us against . . . the president of the United States and his mob.” He urged Republicans to see the warriors defending democracy and “take a tough vote.”AdvertisementIn the end, 10 honorable House Republicans took that tough vote — even though it could cost them their jobs, and even though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) let it be known, in the middle of the House debate, that he would block a Senate trial until at least Jan. 19 — the day before Trump leaves office.One after the other, several of the 139 House Republicans who last week voted to overturn the election results now justified votes against impeachment because “our country needs unity” (Rep. Debbie Lesko, Ariz.) and “our nation is still healing” (Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, Pa.). Several of those who last week engaged in a seditious act now cited Lincoln’s second inaugural call to “bind up the nation’s wounds.”Story continues below advertisement“Unity, after they voted to overturn a free and fair election?” replied Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). He said the Capitol attack “would never have happened if everybody stood up in unity and called out the president when he was not telling the American people the truth.”AdvertisementSome always-Trump Republicans defended Trump’s words inciting the Capitol insurrection, employing a web of false equivalence, whataboutism and warnings that impeachment “will cause further unrest,” as Ronny L. Jackson (R-Tex.), Trump-doctor-turned-congressman, put it. Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) denounced the “unconstitutional” election. QAnon-admiring Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) declared: “I call bullcrap!” Jordan pushed an effort to strip Cheney of her leadership position.But most Republicans were conspicuously unwilling to defend Trump. “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Trump should “accept his share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest,” McCarthy added, and a “censure resolution would be prudent.”Story continues below advertisementCole called Trump’s words “inappropriate and reckless.” Freshman Rep. Nancy Mace (S.C.) said “I hold him accountable . . . for the attack on our Capitol.” Rep. Tom McClintock (Calif.) said Trump “was wrong.” Rep. Jodey Arrington (Tex.) said Trump used “poor judgment.”AdvertisementYa think? Lawmakers described the mob violence they witnessed personally: “I was in this chamber when those gunshots rang.” . . . “Democrats and Republicans hid on the floor, put on gas masks.” . . . “I heard the mob pounding on the door.” . . . “Fearing for my life.”After such personal terror at Trump’s hands, it’s disturbing that only 10 Republicans found the courage to break with him.

It is warranted only when evidence is overwhelming that a public officer is incapable of upholding the public trust.

He fanned the flames of public discord with wild and unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, a direct assault on the most valuable asset any republic has: faith in the fairness of the election process. His call for multiple rallies in Washington in support of his fantasies, culminating in the Jan. 6 rally that turned into the violent storming of the Capitol, showed a reckless disregard for the health of our country. Angry crowds who believe their nation is literally being stolen from them are capable of acts of rash madness. Trump might not have intended for his legions to attack Congress, but only a fool would have so egged them on if violence had been even a remote possibility.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPresident Trump’s statements on Tuesday show that he has no remorse for his actions. He still believes the election was stolen. He still believes his role in organizing and supporting the Jan. 6 mob was appropriate. He says he disdains the violence, but his slow reaction to condemn the riot and weak statements opposing it as it was happening seriously undermine his words. There is every reason to believe that he would have been content had the mob forced a captive or cowed Congress to overturn the election. Such a man cannot sit in the Oval Office.Impeachment would allow senators to remove Trump, but it would also allow them to permanently bar him from ever holding federal office again. That, not his removal from the last seven days of his term, is the real aim of this endeavor. We have seen that he is a tremendously effective demagogue. We know that, absent a legal bar against his future candidacy, he could seek to regain the presidency in 2024 or beyond. We also know that, if successful, he would reenter the Oval Office burning with revenge and with a steely resolve to secure his rule that was largely absent during his current term. Had he been seriously bent on autocracy, Jan. 6 might have been much more effectively planned and possibly successful. The United States cannot take that risk.I did not support impeaching Trump last time. I believed then that, while he might have committed an impeachable offense, his removal would have unleashed public turmoil that would have seriously damaged our republic. It was best to leave the judgment of his conduct to the people via the democratic process. We had that election, and the people rendered their verdict.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMany of my fellow Republicans are likely to disagree with me. Some argue that a second impeachment and removal would be divisive and inflame public passions. It is, and it will. That does not change the choice they face. If they support Trump now, they are willing to admit that someone with his demonstrated character is capable of holding the highest office in the land. That is a terrible misjudgment.Early on Jan. 6, The Post's Kate Woodsome saw signs of violence hours before thousands of former president Donald Trump loyalists besieged the Capitol.

He will no longer be their leader holding back the liberals.

        "article": "Laurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor Emeritus at Harvard Law School and most recently the co-author of “To End A Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.”The Senate appears unlikely to take up the article of impeachment against President Trump before his term ends next Wednesday. That does not require the end of proceedings against him. The Senate retains the constitutional authority — indeed, the constitutional duty — to conduct an impeachment trial against the soon-to-be-former president.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Constitution, Article II, Section 4, provides that the president and other civil officers “shall be removed from Office” following impeachment and conviction by the Senate. Some scholars, most prominently former federal appeals court judge J. Michael Luttig, have argued that because Trump’s term will have already ended and he, by definition, cannot be removed, the impeachment power no longer applies.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith all respect, I disagree. The Constitution references impeachment in six places but nowhere answers that precise question. Article I, Section 3 comes closest to delineating the contours of the Impeachment Power, instructing that “Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”These “judgments” — removal and disqualification — are analytically distinct and linguistically divisible. Their divisibility was first established by the Senate during the 1862 trial of federal-turned-confederate Judge West Humphreys and reaffirmed by a parliamentary inquiry during the 1936 trial of impeached Judge Halsted Ritter. The only court to address the issue agreed with the Senate that an impeachment trial could proceed even after the individual was no longer in office.To be sure, a former officer may no longer be “removed” even upon conviction by a two-thirds vote. But that has no bearing on whether such an ex-officer may be barred permanently from office upon being convicted. That separate judgment would require no more than a simple majority vote.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementConcluding otherwise would all but erase the disqualification power from the Constitution’s text: If an impeachable officer became immune from trial and conviction upon leaving office, any official seeing conviction as imminent could easily remove the prospect of disqualification simply by resigning moments before the Senate’s anticipated verdict.The clear weight of history, original understanding and congressional practice bolsters the case for concluding that the end of Donald Trump’s presidency would not end his Senate trial.The impeachment power derives from the power of the British Parliament. One particular British impeachment featured prominently in the framers’ conception of the power: that of the former colonial governor of India, Warren Hastings. Led by Edmund Burke, the Hastings impeachment was repeatedly referenced during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and, critically, was conducted entirely after Hastings had left office. Given the prominence of the Hastings’s impeachment to the framers, the absence of debate on the question at the federal or state ratifying conventions — not to mention the silence of the Constitution’s text on the point — speaks volumes.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSo it’s unsurprising that Congress has throughout the nation’s history considered the power to try and judge impeachments to extend past an officeholder’s term. The question was first raised during the attempted 1797 impeachment of Sen. William Blount. One of the lead House prosecutors, Rep. James Bayard, and Blount’s lawyer agreed that a civil officer could not escape impeachment through resignation. Former president John Quincy Adams, while serving as a member of Congress many years later, concurred by declaring that “I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of life in my body, amenable to impeachment by this House for everything I did during the time I held any public office.”Likewise, in 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned minutes before the House was set to impeach him; the House still transmitted five articles of impeachment to the Senate. At Belknap’s trial, the Senate voted 37 to 29 that he was “amenable to trial by impeachment …notwithstanding his resignation of said office.” And the House and Senate rules have both long permitted the impeachment and trial of former officers for abuses committed while holding office.Focusing on the purposes of the impeachment power yields the same conclusion. Its function is prospective rather than punitive: to prevent officers who have betrayed their oaths from committing further abuses and thereby inflicting future harm.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe need to protect the nation can sometimes be satisfied merely by removing a dangerous officer from power. Still, the inclusion of a separate power to disqualify is a clear recognition that removal might not always be sufficient. For such cases, the Constitution expressly provided the additional remedy of exclusion.Disqualifying President Trump from ever again holding federal office is a particularly suitable remedy for fomenting and inciting insurrection. It is also fitting in stripping Trump of the very thing that motivated his impeachable offenses: the pursuit of future power.To render this uniquely appropriate remedy unavailable simply because the gravest abuses of power were committed near the very end of a president’s term would be bizarre at best, self-sabotaging at worst. Nothing in the Constitution suggests that a president who has shown himself to be a deadly threat to our survival as a constitutional republic should be able to run out the clock on our ability to condemn his conduct and to ensure that it can never recur.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementcorrectionAn earlier version of this article misidentified the speaker of a quote about presidential impeachments.

        "article": "After nearly a year of failing to contain covid-19, the outgoing Trump administration is finally taking steps that are likely to improve our national pandemic response. On Tuesday, the leaders of Operation Warp Speed announced four actions to expedite vaccine rollout: expanding eligibility, increasing distribution sites, releasing all available vaccines while guaranteeing second doses, and reallocating vaccines to states based on efficiency of their efforts.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightTuesday’s Operation Warp Speed news conference began with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar acknowledging that vaccine administration has not proceeded with the necessary speed and urgency — a remarkable admission for an administration that has long refused to recognize its botched leadership on the coronavirus pandemic. More than four weeks after vaccine shipments began, some 10 million inoculations have been given from 29 million doses shipped. Despite months to develop and implement a plan for faster distribution, inoculations lag far below the projections of 20 million Americans vaccinated by the end of 2020 — and come nowhere close to distributing 100 million doses  as President Trump promised in September.Even worse than the slow rollout are the reports of vaccine doses being thrown out. Some hospitals and pharmacies have had to discard unused vaccine after people didn’t show up for appointments or when health-care workers and nursing-home residents chose not to be vaccinated. Because of strict guidelines prohibiting distribution beyond these prioritized groups, doses couldn’t be reallocated before they expired. Meanwhile, people desperate to receive the vaccine have lined up overnight in some places, only to be turned away.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe newly expanded vaccine eligibility is broad: anyone 65 and older, and all adults with high-risk medical conditions. This guidance overrides the tiers that were painstakingly decided by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee. On paper, the CDC tiers made sense; they used public health principles to define the workers considered most essential or groups most vulnerable to the coronavirus. But in practice, it has not worked to adhere to a rigid protocol of waiting for one vulnerable group to be vaccinated before opening eligibility to other at-risk groups.Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicTo be sure, logistical problems loom with making more than 100 million people eligible for vaccines when neither the supply nor the infrastructure exists to deliver the shots. States could be overwhelmed as they adjust to the new guidance. People could become frustrated when they cannot immediately get vaccinated. These scenarios, though, are better than wasting any doses of vaccine when every dose represents a potential life saved.Azar’s second change — expanding distribution sites — will substantially speed up vaccination rates. I’ve argued before that we need to expand access points to wherever it is that people are. Many patients prefer to receive vaccines through their regular doctor or pharmacy, so it helps that Operation Warp Speed plans to increase distribution through community health centers and local pharmacies. Already, Los Angeles, New York, Houston and other cities are converting stadiums into mass vaccination sites where thousands of people can be inoculated every day. I’m thrilled that the federal government agrees with the need for such mass vaccination locations and supports standing up these sites.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAzar also stated that all available doses of the coronavirus vaccine will be released. This parallels plans that President-elect Joe Biden’s team announced last week. Unlike the Biden statement, which has not provided such a clear assurance, Azar was unequivocal that all first doses of the vaccine would be followed by timely administration of second doses. This is how clinical trials for the authorized vaccines were done, and adhering to the clearly defined protocol is critical to maintaining public trust.The part of the Trump administration’s new strategy I like most is the plan to recalculate how many doses each state receives based on how quickly the states are administering the supply they have. States that have been efficiently distributing doses are showing that they can deliver vaccines with the urgency required. Reward them by sending more doses their way. To prevent exacerbating inequities, states that are laggards should be given federal assistance to improve their infrastructure. But in the meantime, vaccines shouldn’t be given to these states only to sit in storage. This allocation plan also incentivizes states to report inoculations in real time or close to it.After months of bungled coronavirus responses, the Trump administration has unveiled some much-needed course corrections. Of course, state and local health departments should have been given the resources they requested long ago, and because that didn’t happen, the overall vaccination effort is months behind where it could and should be. Still, these plans deserve praise as a step in the right direction: They’re helping to set up America’s vaccination program — and the incoming Biden administration — for success against the pandemic.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRead more:Drew Altman: We need a better way of distributing the covid-19 vaccine.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis idea — that Trump’s mesmerizing powers will keep tens of millions of Americans in thrall to him long into the future — has been stated so often, including by me, that everyone has come to accept it as a certainty.But what if it isn’t a certainty at all? What if this is a mirage that is rapidly dissolving before our very eyes?Story continues below advertisementThis might seem like a strange notion, coming after Trump successfully incited a mob of thousands to violently assault our seat of government. But, paradoxically, that very event may be setting in motion the process by which that fearsome power is rapidly waning.AdvertisementThe House is set to impeach Trump on Wednesday for inciting that insurrection, and five House Republicans have announced they will vote yes, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of leadership. At least a dozen might follow. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has privately asked Republicans if he should call for Trump’s resignation.Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has reportedly concluded that Trump did commit impeachable offenses and believes impeachment will make it easier for the GOP to expunge the stain of Trump. He is said to be leaning toward voting for conviction.Trump’s spinners threaten RepublicansTrump’s allies have worked furiously to stave off such defections by invoking the specter of an enraged MAGA Nation that will punish Republicans for years. One of Trump’s highest profile propagandists is aggressively pushing polling that shows GOP voters oppose impeachment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMeanwhile, both of Trump’s older sons — Eric and Don Jr. — wielded the threat of primaries against Republican lawmakers to pressure them into voting last week to overturn the election. They’ll surely escalate that in the impeachment context.Indeed, Eric just underscored that his father’s vast army will remain, claiming the president “would get followed to the ends of the Earth by a hundred million Americans.” A former White House adviser is even predicting that MAGA Nation might form a third party of “Trumpists.”Trump himself has pushed this line in his own way, telling reporters Tuesday that impeachment is causing “tremendous anger.” That’s properly understood as a tacit threat of more mob action against Democrats — action from his mob — but also against Republicans who go along.Story continues below advertisementBut this time around, these threats don’t seem to be striking the usual spasms of fear into Republicans.AdvertisementCase in point: The Post reports that the White House is not leaning on GOP lawmakers to oppose impeachment. Why not? Because as Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs reports, White House aides know perfectly well that Republican members of Congress don’t “have any real worries about any retaliation from Trump,” because he has “been essentially castrated without his Twitter account.”That rings true, and it’s a striking repudiation of the illusion that Trump’s spinners are weaving. So what does that mean about MAGA Nation’s future ability to terrorize Republican officials?The future of MAGA NationThe makeup of the mob that stormed the Capitol is hard to pin down. There were white supremacist and white nationalist groups, and extremists such as the Proud Boys and QAnon, and a lot of Christian theocrats. It wasn’t primarily a working-class movement: There were a lot of reactionary business owner-operator types.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThey appeared united by a belief — or a professed belief — that the election was stolen from Trump. Some segment of them clearly hew to the notion that violent nullification of election outcomes they hate is their way forward, via the direct intimidation or possibly even the murder of lawmakers elected by their fellow Americans to represent themselves.That threat will continue and possibly metastasize into something worse. Federal law enforcement agencies are now bracing for more violence when Joe Biden is inaugurated. Armed protests are anticipated at many state Capitols. Lawmakers are getting briefed on assassination threats.It might be time to start thinking of this as a genuine violent insurgency, as Juliette Kayyem and David French suggest, with Trump as its spiritual leader. And if that is so, they note, then one solution is what you might call maximum containment, or limiting Trump’s oxygen wherever possible and defeating this movement on every front.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhat’s striking is that some Republican lawmakers suddenly appear more oriented toward a general posture of maximum containment. It’s almost as if they’re seizing on last week’s events to persuade themselves that the movement Trump will actually command going forward has revealed itself to be more politically extreme and marginal — albeit perhaps able to do far greater damage with smaller numbers — than they previously permitted themselves to think.To be clear, that doesn’t mean many Republicans will support impeaching or removing Trump. It’s likely that maybe a dozen in the House and maybe a handful of senators will go along with that at best. It’s still extremely unlikely he’ll get removed.But even if so, as GOP strategist Liam Donovan suggests, that’s likely more because there isn’t great political upside for most Republicans in supporting impeachment than because there’s reason for them to fear it.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHere’s a crazy suggestion: We might look back on this as the moment that Trump’s ability to strike abject terror into Republican lawmakers began to fizzle. Indeed, let’s go even further out on a limb and predict that, in the end, those supposedly frightful threats of Trumpist primaries will end up amounting to little or nothing.Read more:Greg Sargent: Republicans must unambiguously admit that Trump’s lies threaten more violenceMax Boot: If Republicans want to promote unity, they should join Democrats in impeaching TrumpJennifer Rubin: For some Republicans, it’s time to head for the exitsJennifer Rubin: Republicans who aren’t willing to act against sedition are complicitMolly Roberts: Trump botched the perfect getaway",

        "article": "PRESIDENT TRUMP became on Wednesday the first president to be impeached twice, as 222 Democrats and 10 Republicans in the House voted to indict him for his incitement of the Capitol riot. Among them was Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican in the House GOP caucus, who, in following her conscience, bravely exposed herself to severe criticism from the pro-Trump elements of her party.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightReports indicate some Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), are considering voting to convict Mr. Trump in a future Senate trial. Others who shy from impeachment are considering censure or trying to force Mr. Trump to resign. After four years of outrage and humiliation, at least some key GOP leaders are breaking with the worst president in modern U.S. history.There is no doubt Mr. Trump deserved to be impeached. As Ms. Cheney explained, “The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not.”Leer en español: Trump merecía ser impugnado. El Senado debe condenarlo rápidamente.Impeaching Mr. Trump now does not obviate the need for further investigation. Large questions remain: How close did the mob come to harming members of Congress or the vice president? Was there a conspiracy? Were other GOP leaders involved? What was the source of the pipe bombs discovered on Jan. 6? Why was the Capitol so exposed and backup seemingly so unavailable? What measures must be taken to ensure this never happens again?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementEven so, though “much more will become clear in coming days and weeks,” Ms. Cheney noted, “what we know now is enough.” The known scale of Mr. Trump’s offense already qualifies him for severe punishment, and the danger he poses to American civic life is too substantial to ignore. The impeachment power must be nimble enough to address a situation like Watergate, where there was time to conduct a deep investigation to ascertain the president’s guilt, and the Capitol raid, in which the president’s obvious culpability and the continuing risk he poses warrant summary removal.That is why we hope Mr. McConnell reconsiders his reported reluctance to move swiftly toward a trial. The president’s term ends in any case next Wednesday, but removal first would send an important message. It also would be unquestionably legitimate, whereas some scholars believe the Senate does not have the constitutional right to try, convict and bar from future office a president after his term ends. A delayed or a lengthy Senate trial could overshadow President-elect Joe Biden’s opening days, slowing confirmation of his appointees — with attendant risk to national and homeland security — and derailing his legislative agenda.If Mr. McConnell refuses to convene the Senate this week, senators must move with dispatch once they have convened, and split their time between trying Mr. Trump and enabling the launch of the Biden administration. But the nation would be better served by a prompt trial ending in the guilty verdict Mr. Trump deserves.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRead more:Henry Olsen: Republicans should impeach President TrumpJennifer Rubin: Impeachment is just the start.

And Republicans must recognize both the fact of his electoral defeat and his role in inspiring insurrection against our nation’s system of free government.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis is why Democrats in the House of Representatives were right to force the issue of impeachment after Trump’s instigation of an attack on the nation’s Capitol, and the democratic process itself, whose extreme violence becomes ever clearer as more video from the assault emerges. The impeachment measure passed 232 to 197 with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats.Underlying the impeachment debate was a struggle over what steps are required to bring the nation together.Story continues below advertisementThe solutions endorsed by most Republicans? Amnesia, evasion and denial.AdvertisementAmnesia about their own party’s role in encouraging Trump for four years. Evasion of the party’s complicity in advancing Trump’s dangerous falsehood that President-elect Joe Biden stole an election that the Democrat won decisively. And denial of their own responsibility, outlined eloquently by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) during the debate over electoral college votes, to tell their own supporters the truth about the election’s outcome, and about Trump himself.There is a school of thought — it has subscribers beyond the Republican duck-and-cover crowd — that impeaching Trump would get in the way of Biden’s effort to launch his presidency in a brisk and unifying way.Story continues below advertisementRepublicans latched onto this argument Wednesday. In opposing impeachment, few of them tried to defend Trump. They just sought excuses to vote with him one last time. Thus, many who last week were willing to rip the nation apart by voting to challenge Biden’s victory were suddenly apostles of St. Francis of Assisi. Warm togetherness, they insisted, was their only purpose.Advertisement“Let us look forward, not backward,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said on the House floor during the debate. “Let us come together, not apart. Let us celebrate the peaceful transition of power to a new president, rather than impeaching an old president.”That sounds lovely until you recognize a hard lesson from history: After a deeply divisive struggle, there can be no durable unity if one side continues to propagate myths, if those who have ripped a nation apart refuse to acknowledge their role in deepening its schisms, if crimes committed are swept under a rug woven from the threads of politically convenient forgetfulness.Story continues below advertisementThe effort to create a new order of racial justice in the South after our Civil War was thwarted for nearly a century because of myths spun by Confederates who cast a war for slavery as a noble lost cause and Reconstruction, an effort to democratize an unjust society, as oppressive. The Weimar Republic, Germany’s noble democratic experiment, failed because large parts of the country’s political elite refused to acknowledge its own failures in World War I and never accepted the new regime.AdvertisementIn our time, the United States will move forward only if Trump’s radical attacks on democracy itself are recognized and condemned, only if his false claims are repudiated by his own party, only if every form of false equivalence aimed at diminishing or relativizing Trump’s shameful behavior is thoroughly and completely discredited.It fell to a brave Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, to offer her party a better path. Her eloquent case for impeachment on Tuesday was cited again and again by Democrats.Story continues below advertisement“The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President,” Cheney wrote. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.”AdvertisementThus did the No. 3 House Republican stand up even as Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, one of Trump’s most servile defenders, urged the House to “resist the temptations of further polarization.” But guess what? It took this fight and this outrage to get McCarthy (Calif.), finally, to acknowledge that Biden won the election legitimately. The polarizers only oppose polarization when their bluff is being called.“You know,” said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), “what happened would never have happened if everybody stood up in unity and called out the president when he was not telling the American people the truth, when he was pushing a big lie. We will never have unity without truth, and also without accountability.”Story continues below advertisementLast Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who is one of the most conciliatory members of either party, spoke as the former Divinity School student he was once was. “There can only be reconciliation,” he said, “with repentance.” And as McGovern suggested, the road to repentance will be paved by truth and accountability.

That’s what service to Trump gets you. Only a fool would mistake his anchor chain for a kite string now.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRuin awaits him. The king of social media has been de-platformed, and the once-gilded Trump brand stands for shattered glass, battered police officers — one fatally — and human feces tracked across marble floors. The Trump flag flies over phalanxes in body armor, spouting nonsense and threats, while brandishing rifles, handguns, stun guns and bear-repellent spray in gatherings across the country.Banks have closed their windows to him, as massive debts loom near. A grand jury in New York has begun gathering evidence for a potential felony prosecution. And his dearest post-presidential ambition — to have the major championships of golf played on courses bearing his name — is dead. The Professional Golfers’ Association has scrapped plans to play the 2022 PGA Championship at the Trump course in Bedminster, N.J. The Royal & Ancient Golf Club in Scotland has shot down the idea that its venerable Open Championship will be played at Turnberry as long as Trump owns it.No doubt, Trump thinks this is just another twist in the self-orchestrated melodrama of his life, and a particular twist at that. This is not a man who understands the power of personal redemption through atonement or apology. The only path back that his imagination can perceive is through conflict: Trump the victim, Trump against his enemies, Trump triumphant. Imagine that Trump is a plummeting elevator car. Only friction can arrest his plunge.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGiven the spectacle of his self-immolation, no ordinary foil will do. Trump needs his co-stars from past epic battles — the same Democrats he fought through an election, an impeachment and another election, the one he couldn’t bear to end. To borrow a phrase, Democrats should stand back and stand by; but alas, the idea of a sequel is making the rounds in Washington. In their righteous and proper anger over the Trump Riot and all that led up to it, many Democrats are talking themselves into one more go-round.An impeachment vote in the House appears inevitable. But allowing a second impeachment process to spill past Inauguration Day, though it might please the gods of justice, among mortals would serve only Trump. The only thing he has left to lose is relevance. He feeds on controversy. Attention is his oxygen. Democrats can turn off the life support. Let his future bankruptcies play out in the business pages. Let his conspiracy theories molder on grocery-store racks. Let his plea bargains be reported in the second or third segment of the evening news.

        "article": "We’ve come a long way from the days when social media was largely viewed as a positive development that boosted access and participation in the realm of mass communications. Anyone and everyone could have a voice and access to an audience.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightPresident Trump recognized the value of being able to reach his base without the filter of the mainstream media — that is, without fact-checkers, follow-up questions or editorial comments. Until recently, when Twitter began qualifying his tweets with explanatory notes, the various platforms served him well.So much for all that. In the wake of last week’s breach of the U.S. Capitol, these social media titans have shut down the president of the United States.Story continues below advertisementBoth Twitter and Facebook have blocked Trump indefinitely. Amazon, which owns the gaming streaming site Twitch, disabled Trump’s channel indefinitely. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon have dropped Parler, a platform similar to Twitter but without the moderating interference of third-party moderators and editorial boards. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)AdvertisementIn some respects — and surely to millions of people fed up with Trump — these censorial actions come as a relief. Not only were some of his postings intentionally misleading, but many were potentially dangerous. Some would say demonstrably so. His repeated claims to have won the 2020 election and that the election was “stolen” from him may not have directly caused the riots that resulted in five people’s deaths, but they can’t be considered unrelated, either.We know enough about Trump to know that he needs the spotlight, no matter the context. A riot may be a bad thing for the country, but it feels like a good thing if you’re a sore loser with an insatiable appetite for attention and an attraction to chaos. Trump’s encouragement of the protesters, and a false promise to march down Pennsylvania Avenue with them, weren’t exactly throwing sand on a fire.Story continues below advertisementCall me crazy, but isn’t it better to know what Trump is thinking — and what his minions are plotting — than to force them into hiding? Blocking their conversation from the public square is about as effective as plugging your ears and singing tra-la-la-la-la-la-la. I’ve always viewed social media like the insect world: Just because you can’t see or hear them doesn’t mean they’re not busy.AdvertisementThus, when we force the insurgency underground, we don’t eliminate it. We merely condemn its members to the shadows where resentment festers and morphs into even darker shades of anger and hatred. I’d rather endure annoying tweets and hostile insults than not know who my enemies are or what they’re planning next. Effectively, we eliminate some of our best intelligence about groups’ plans to arm themselves and descend on every state capitol on Inauguration Day.Nor does the absence of social media disarm anyone. During the 1960s civil-rights and antiwar movements, millions of people converged in cities across the country without the aid of cellphones and laptops. Does anyone really think that the people behind last week’s jackass rodeo can’t pull it off again without Twitter or Facebook?Story continues below advertisementIn times of uncivil discourse, it may make us feel virtuous to separate ourselves from society’s coarser elements. It may seem entirely fair to uninvite people who abuse basic rules of decorum or have no devotion to objective truth.AdvertisementOne could even argue that Twitter and Facebook are providing a valuable public service by blocking objectionable, seditionist speech — an act of responsible citizenship that isn’t the same as when government imposes limitations to suppress individual liberty.Admittedly, giant social media companies can often seem like quasi-governmental entities by virtue of their power to decide which speech is acceptable — or that serves their own political purposes. This, too, is troubling.Story continues below advertisementBut more troubling is this likely truth: Trump will leave the White House on Jan. 20. But having raised more than $200 million since the election, he won’t be silenced for long. Nor is his base going away. Not all of them were part of the fracas, we should remind ourselves. Thus, the better part of prudence, it seems, would be to invite everyone out into the open and let them talk.

        "article": "Although House Democrats are moving forward with impeachment proceedings, a conviction won’t occur before President Trump leaves office — and his Cabinet shows little interest in invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him. That means we face the prospect of eight days in which Trump, who incited an attack on the U.S. Capitol last week, controls all the formidable instruments of executive power. Should Trump decide to wreak more havoc, the consequences may hinge on the consciences of officials charged with executing the president’s orders.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightLast week, Trump exercised his informal authority through his bully pulpit to encourage his supporters to interfere with Congress’s counting of electoral college voters. Without slighting the tragedy that ensued, it is worth emphasizing how much worse it could have been had the president invoked the formal legal powers at his beck and call. It remains a live risk that he uses those powers now. And this situation should cause Congress and the courts to rethink just how much power they have granted the president.In his last days in office, Trump has potent tools that might be wielded against the republic — or that could lead to destabilizing international conflict. The statutes setting forth the military chain of command, for example, vest him with unyielding authority relative to his secretary of defense — who is in this case a loyalist serving as acting secretary (Christopher C. Miller). While soldiers are not required to follow unlawful orders, officers have always been exceedingly leery of claiming broad power to second-guess the legality of civilian instructions. A rightful safeguard of civilian control over the military in ordinary times, such deference, could have very different implications for the next week. It is not hard to imagine the White House ordering, say, a plainly unlawful military action against Iran. Imagine a targeted killing such as that of Qasem Soleimani, but with an even thinner legal justification. Or consider an actual incursion onto Iranian soil in violation of U.S. and international law.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCongress can be thanked also for a series of Insurrection Acts that assign broad authority to the president to decide whether to deploy military force within our borders. One provision gives the president power to call out troops if some “unlawful combination” or “conspiracy … opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.” These provisions, critically, vest the president with broad power to make factual determinations of when such a “conspiracy” exists. And while Congress in 1948 barred troop deployments at polling places during elections, there are few other formal restrictions on the power to quash “insurrections.”After June’s events in Lafayette Square, in which National Guard and U.S. Park police violently cleared peaceful protesters to enable a political stunt, it is all too easy to imagine how Trump might misuse these powers.Using the 14th Amendment to bar Trump from office could take yearsBut these are not the limit of disquieting presidential authorities: There is also the president’s sweeping control over federal criminal indictments. Thoughtful commentators have observed that a president would be “well within his legal rights” to “directly instruct” the attorney general not to prosecute a specific individual. This may one day mean that President-elect Joe Biden might intervene in a decision not to charge Trump after he leaves office. But today there is at least a question whether a president can order his acting attorney general to prosecute specific people. It’s not all that hard to imagine this norm-defying president from ordering prosecutions of Biden or Harris with the manifest intention of derailing inauguration. After all, he has threatened to use the prosecution power against political enemies for years now.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn addition to Congress’s ceding of powers to the president, the Supreme Court has increasingly come to associate democracy with presidential potency. It has suggested that “democratic governance” is possible only if the president has unfettered authority over executive-branch subordinates, for example. Whatever the merits of that view in ordinary times, it is highly disconcerting at the present moment.There have long been calls for the House and Senate to rein in these powers, yet our representatives have not acted. After last week’s riot at the Capitol, however, there may well be veto-proof supermajorities to limit any one of these authorities by way of statute (though not before the inauguration) — and this could have lasting salutary effects. Limiting the insurrection power would prevent a reoccurrence of the events of Lafayette Square under a future president. Congress could define with precision the triggers that allowed the use of troops around political protests, and in relation to the workings of democratic institutions. Congress could also limit deployments of non-emergency military force in the lame duck period after an election.For obvious reasons, the debate this week has been about Trump’s personal irresponsibility and individual acts — not the legal structures that help underpin his threat to democratic order. And these structures cannot be changed at a moment’s notice. So for the next week we are thrown back upon the good conscience of the men and women who might receive anti-democratic orders. The orders that will imperil the republic will not be illegal in the sense that they assert powers that do not exist; rather, they will be illegal in the sense that they will turn on false factual claims — the lie of the stolen election, the fable of the anti-Trump “deep state,” the fabrication of crimes by a political opponent.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAlthough we cannot be certain, there is some reason for guarded optimism that people will refuse any illegal orders. Rep. Elise Slotkin (D-Mich.) recounted that on Wednesday, when the administration authorized the belated deployment of National Guard to the Capitol, “the Chairman and the acting Secretary of Defense did not ask the Commander in Chief for advice. They discussed it with the Vice President and made their call.” We will all watch anxiously in hopes such good sense prevails for long enough for the proximate crisis to pass. After that, more robust safeguards against a potential rogue president can be installed.",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAllies such as Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon and Newt Gingrich frequently made this comparison. The organizer of Trump’s inaugural festivities, Tom Barrack, looked into opening up the White House to the general public for a party that would be modeled on what Jackson hosted when he became the seventh president. “Unfortunately, security concerns are different than they were in 1829,” Barrack said in 2017.Story continues below advertisementWhen Trump was sworn in, he hung Old Hickory’s portrait prominently in the Oval Office, made a pilgrimage to his Nashville estate and blocked plans to replace Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman.But Trump will likely be remembered much more in the category of another 19th-century president from Tennessee. Next week, Trump will become the first president to refuse to attend his successor’s inauguration since President Andrew Johnson snubbed Ulysses S. Grant in 1869.Johnson was the first of three presidents to be impeached. Trump is poised to become the first president to be impeached twice.AdvertisementWhile Jackson and Trump both ran as populists, Jackson actually practiced what he preached. Google the Bank War if you have never studied that period. On the other hand, Trump has governed more often as a plutocrat than a populist.Story continues below advertisementUnlike Jackson, who won reelection in a landslide and has an epoch of U.S. history named for him, Johnson left office after one term. He was loathed by a majority of Americans and denied his party’s nomination for a full term.Historians occasionally debate whether Johnson was the worst president in U.S. history – or just one of the worst two or three. Johnson was a demagogue who played on racial fears as he battled with radical Republicans over Reconstruction. He traveled the country to give long-winded speeches at rallies that oozed with grievance. In one notorious episode, on George Washington’s birthday, Johnson gave a speech in which he referred to himself more than 200 times and described congressmen with whom he disagreed as traitors.AdvertisementJust like the current lame-duck president, Johnson issued a flurry of scandalous pardons during his final Christmas in the White House.Story continues below advertisementIronically, Trump’s presidency is ending with current and former members of his Cabinet turning on him. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao resigned in protest last week after Trump incited an act of insurrection against the legislative branch, which left five dead. John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff and secretary of homeland security, said he would vote to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump if he was still in the Cabinet. Mick Mulvaney, another former Trump chief of staff and the ex-director of the Office of Management and Budget, resigned his position as Trump’s special envoy to Northern Ireland.Johnson was impeached after firing Edwin Stanton as secretary of war. He had inherited Stanton and the rest of his Cabinet from President Abraham Lincoln. Nervous he would lose reelection in 1864, Lincoln had dumped his first-term vice president, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, for Johnson, a so-called War Democrat who was then the military governor of Tennessee. The unity ticket was part of an effort to appeal to moderates in the border states, and it achieved its intended goal: Lincoln won reelection by 10 points after the Union victory in Atlanta. He carried Tennessee but lost the neighboring state of Kentucky to George McClellan. AdvertisementUnlike the teetotaler Trump, Johnson was an alcoholic. He showed up drunk to Lincoln’s second inauguration. One month later, he became the 17th president.Story continues below advertisementIn lieu of a second impeachment, a growing number of constitutional scholars and historians who specialize in the Reconstruction period are suggesting a remedy from 1868 to punish Trump for his role in last week’s events. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment could be used to bar Trump from holding another federal office if he is found to have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against” the United States. This provision was written largely to prevent Johnson from unilaterally granting blanket pardons to ex-Confederates, without congressional support, that might allow them to run for office again.“The finding could be accomplished by a simple majority vote of both houses, in contrast to the requirement in impeachment proceedings that the Senate vote to convict by a two-thirds majority,” Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman and Indiana University law professor Gerard Magliocca write in an op-ed for today’s newspaper. “Congress would simply need to declare that Trump engaged in an act of ‘insurrection or rebellion’ by encouraging the attack on the Capitol. Under the 14th Amendment, Trump could run for the White House again only if he were able to persuade a future Congress to, ‘by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.’”More political falloutNew details emerge about Trump's initial refusal to act after the mob stormed the Capitol.“Hiding from the rioters in a secret location away from the Capitol, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) appealed to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) phoned Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. And Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Trump confidante and former White House senior adviser, called an aide who she knew was standing at the president’s side,” Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Phil Rucker report. “But as senators and House members trapped inside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday begged for immediate help during the siege, they struggled to get through to the president, who — safely ensconced in the West Wing — was too busy watching fiery TV images of the crisis unfolding around them to act or even bother to hear their pleas. … ‘It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,’ Graham said in an interview. ‘The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.’ AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement\"Trump ultimately — and begrudgingly — urged his supporters to ‘go home in peace.’ But the six hours between when the Capitol was breached shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday afternoon and when it was finally declared secure around 8 p.m. that evening reveal a president paralyzed … Press officials had begun discussing a statement from Trump around 2 p.m. … But they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the president and could only take the matter to Chief of Staff Mark Meadows … [Donald] Trump Jr. headed to the airport for a shuttle flight home to New York. … An aide called Trump Jr. and suggested he immediately issue a statement urging the rioters to stop. At 2:17 p.m., Trump Jr. hit send on a tweet as he boarded the plane: ‘This is wrong and not who we are,’ he wrote. … But the president himself was busy enjoying the spectacle. … “McCarthy did eventually reach Trump, but later told allies that he found the president distracted. So McCarthy repeatedly appeared on television to describe the mayhem, an adviser said, in an effort to explain just how dire the situation was. … At one point, Trump worried that the unruly group was frightening GOP lawmakers from doing his bidding and objecting to the election results. … [Around 4 p.m.], the White House was preparing to put out a video address on behalf of the president. … Trump aides did three takes of the video and chose the most palatable option — despite some West Wing consternation that the president had called the violent protesters ‘very special.’ …\"The following evening, on Thursday, Trump released another video, the closest advisers say he is likely to come to a concession speech. … His calls for healing and reconciliation were more than a day too late, many aides said. Yet as Trump watched the media coverage of his video, he grew angry. The president said he wished he hadn’t done it … because he feared that the calming words made him look weak.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn a Monday phone call with McCarthy, Trump falsely accused leftists of being behind the insurrection. McCarthy responded: “It’s not Antifa. It’s MAGA. I know. I was there.” (Axios) Shortly before convening a conference call of House Republicans later in the day, McCarthy sent a memo floating several alternatives to impeachment, including a censure resolution, a bipartisan investigative commission and changes to the law governing the counting of electoral votes. On the call with his GOP colleagues, McCarthy said Trump privately agreed that he bore some responsibility for Wednesday’s riot, according to two Republicans who heard his remarks. (Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane)New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, a key Trump supporter in 2016, announced that he will no longer accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom award from him on Thursday. He said he had agreed to accept the award before last week’s violence. “Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation’s values, freedom and democracy,” Belichick said in a statement. (Cindy Boren and Mark Maske)Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) holds Trump responsible for inciting the mob. “I called and texted my closest contact at the White House to urge that the president immediately tell the rioters to stop their violence and go home. But Trump completely undercut that message by repeating his grievances and telling the rioters that he knew how they felt,\" Collins writes in the Bangor Daily News.A narrow majority of Americans – 52 percent – say Trump should be removed from office, and 53 percent say he should resign, per a new Quinnipiac poll. The same survey shows Trump’s job approval rating has fallen to 33 percent, matching his previous all-time low in the aftermath of Charlottesville in 2017. A group of 24 former House Republican lawmakers endorsed impeaching Trump. In an open letter, they say “there is no excuse for nor defense of a President of the United States to actively orchestrate an insurrection on a separate but coequal branch of government.”William Webster, the former federal judge, FBI director and CIA director, endorses Trump’s impeachment. “I’m a lifelong Republican, but I am an American first,” he writes in an op-ed for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “Never in my 96 years did I imagine a sitting president of the United States, abetted by numerous members of Congress, using tools of deception and innuendo to challenge the will of the American people in choosing their leadership. Abraham Lincoln warned us that ‘America will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.’”Pence and Trump are speaking again. “Vice President Pence was in hiding from a violent mob of Trump supporters in the Capitol last Wednesday when the presidential tweet attacking him posted. ‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution,’” Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m., Dawsey and Parker report. “Trump never called him that day or in the days following to make sure Pence was okay — or to discuss a governmental response to the deadly riots the president incited. … A senior administration official said Trump and Pence finally met in the Oval Office on Monday night and ‘had a good conversation, discussing the week ahead and reflecting on the last four years of the administration’s work and accomplishments.’ Pence is under pressure from Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment … but he is not expected to do so, aides said. Trump’s treatment of Pence has reverberated badly in the White House and among campaign aides, many of whom see it as unseemly and unfair. One senior administration official described it as ‘unconscionable, even for the president.’\"Quote of the day\"I’ve been studying authoritarian regimes for three decades, and I know the signs of a coup when I see them,” writes Fiona Hill, who formerly served as the senior director for European and Russian affairs on Trump's National Security Council. (Politico)Trump has been advised he potentially could face civil liability connected to his role in encouraging the mob.“‘Think O.J.,’ an adviser explained it to Trump, according to one source. It was a reference to O.J. Simpson, who was found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife and a friend but later faced stiff civil damages after being sued by his ex-wife's family,” ABC News reports. \"Prior to Wednesday, the president and his advisers had been discussing a self-pardon – something that would be both historic and untested in American history – in the wake of a phone call with Trump and Georgia election officials that was made public. The sources say if the president were to self-pardon, it would only strengthen the motivation to bring civil cases against the 45th president.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump’s private business failed to pay a $49,000 hotel bill incurred during his 2017 inaugural — and then, after the bill went to a collections agency, Trump’s nonprofit inaugural committee improperly agreed to pay the charge instead, according to a new filing from the D.C. attorney general.

(Tony Romm)Rudy Giuliani could be disbarred.The New York State Bar Association will consider expelling Trump's personal lawyer, and a state lawmaker is seeking his disbarment after inflammatory comments during a rally preceding last week's deadly insurrection. “In a statement Monday, the bar association said it has received ‘hundreds of complaints in recent months’ about the former New York mayor and his failed bid to help Trump overturn his loss,” Shayna Jacobs reports. “‘Mr. Giuliani’s words quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election’s outcome to take matters into their own hands,’ a spokeswoman for the group, Susan DeSantis, said in the statement. … New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat who represents parts of Manhattan, filed a formal complaint to an appellate court related to ‘rampant and egregious violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct’ and Giuliani’s ‘complicity’ in inciting last week’s violence. … Speaking to a charged crowd of thousands near the White House on Wednesday, Giuliani said: ‘If we’re wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we’re right, a lot of them will go to jail. So let’s have trial by combat!’”More law enforcement falloutSeveral Capitol Police officers suspended, and more than a dozen are under investigation. “Eight separate investigations have been launched into the actions of Capitol officers,” Aaron Davis, Rebecca Tan and Beth Reinhard report. “In one of the cases, officers had posted what Capitol Police investigators found to be messages showing support for the rally on Wednesday that preceded the attack on the complex, including touting Trump’s baseless contention that the election had been stolen through voter fraud. … Investigators in another instance found that a Capitol officer had posted ‘inappropriate’ images of Biden on a social media account. … House and Senate lawmakers have called for investigations into the security failures … On Monday, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), whose committee has financial oversight of the Capitol Police, told reporters in a video conference call that one of those suspended was captured in images of the riot that went viral online. The photo appears to show a Capitol officer allowing or even posing for a rioter to take a picture with the officer. … The other officer who was suspended was seen outside the complex wearing a red Make America Great Again baseball cap at the time rioters were surrounding the Capitol, Ryan said.”Chad Wolf resigns as acting homeland security secretary.“Wolf, who was overseas in the Middle East last week during the siege, attributed his decision to ‘recent events’ and court rulings that have challenged the legality of his appointment by the Trump administration to run the department,” Nick Miroff and Carol Leonnig report. “In a statement to Department of Homeland Security staff, Wolf said he was ‘saddened to take this step,’ having previously announced plans to remain on the job through the end of the Trump administration. … Chase Jennings, a DHS spokesman, said Wolf will remain at the department in his Senate-confirmed role as undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans. … AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Several lawmakers have called for hearings to question why Wolf and DHS failed to anticipate threats posed by Trump’s followers … In one of his final moves as acting secretary Monday, Wolf announced that the U.S. Secret Service would take over security preparations for the inauguration on Wednesday, six days ahead of schedule … Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called Wolf’s decision to step down Monday ‘questionable.’ ‘He has chosen to resign during a time of national crisis and when domestic terrorists may be planning additional attacks on our government,’ Thompson said.” Up to 15,000 National Guard members could be deployed to D.C. for the inauguration. That announcement was made “as lawmakers questioned the military’s ability to respond quickly to domestic crises and urged a crackdown on possible extremists in its ranks,” Dan Lamothe reports. “A contingent of 340 D.C. National Guard members had been activated ahead of the riot … But the guardsmen were unarmed and mostly on traffic duty in other parts of the District, in a limited mission that city officials had approved. Once the riot began, lawmakers and D.C. officials pleaded with defense officials to send National Guard members to help, but none arrived for hours as details were finalized … Defense officials have since activated thousands of National Guard members, with 6,000 in the city as of Monday, said Army Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau. Up to 10,000 are expected to be deployed by Saturday, with the possibility for even more on the streets by the inauguration on Jan. 20, he said. … The National Guard members will carry weapons based on discussions with the FBI, police and other agencies.”  The FBI warns that armed far-right extremist groups plan to march on state capitals this weekend.“The memo is something of a raw intelligence product, compiling information gathered by the bureau and several other government agencies,” Tim Craig, Holly Bailey and Matt Zapotosky report. \"Some of it is unverified, and the threat is likely to differ significantly from place to place, though the memo said there were plans in all 50 state capitals … But the data points it highlights for law enforcement are nonetheless troubling — including that there was information suggesting people might storm government offices, or stage an uprising were Trump to be removed from office. … On Monday, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) announced that he was activating the National Guard to provide support for the Capitol Police in Madison. … In Arizona, officials had erected a double-layer chain-link fence around the Capitol complex in Phoenix. … Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) called up 750 National Guard troops to help protect the Capitol, where the legislature kicked off its annual session Monday.”Advertisement“Another right-wing group stormed the state capitol in Salem, Ore., trying to break into the building while legislators met for a special session on Dec. 21. The capitol’s locked doors kept the crowd at bay — until Republican state Rep. Mike Nearman coolly walked through an exit and held the doors open as far-right demonstrators raced inside,” Katie Shepherd reports. “On Monday, after surveillance video showing Nearman’s role in the incursion became public, his colleagues stripped his committee assignments, restricted his access to the capitol building, and fined him for the damage caused by the crowd after he opened the door. … Few Republicans have publicly criticized Nearman.”In a call last night, Capitol Police briefed House members on three potential plots.“The first is a demonstration billed as the ‘largest armed protest ever to take place on American soil.’ Another is a protest in honor of Ashli Babbitt, the woman killed while trying to climb into the Speaker’s Lobby during Wednesday’s pro-Trump siege of the Capitol. And another demonstration, which three members said was by far the most concerning plot, would involve insurrectionists forming a perimeter around the Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court, and then blocking Democrats from entering the Capitol ― perhaps even killing them ― so that Republicans could take control of the government,” HuffPost reports. “‘It was pretty overwhelming,’ one member said. … Lawmakers were told that the plot to encircle the Capitol also included plans to surround the White House ― so that no one could harm Trump ― and the Supreme Court, simply to shut down the courts. … All of these plots may never materialize. The Capitol Police have established a new perimeter with fencing and razor wire … But while Capitol Police assured members they were prepared for these terrorist plots, there was obvious concern from a number of lawmakers.” D.C. leaders issue urgent pleas for Americans to stay away next week.\"'If I’m scared of anything it’s for our democracy,’ D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said at a Monday news conference, responding to a reporter who asked if she feared what might happen on Inauguration Day. ‘Because we have factions in our country . . . that are armed and dangerous,’” Emily Davies reports. “Bowser, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) held a joint call on Monday to discuss planning for the 59th presidential inauguration and agreed to discourage all in-person attendance in the interest of public safety. … One online post cited by Alethea Group, an anti-disinformation organization, has called for an ‘ARMED MARCH ON CAPITOL HILL & ALL STATE CAPITOLS.’ Others have discussed a ‘Million Militia March’ on Inauguration Day. … Bowser, who said she will be briefed by the FBI daily on threats to the city, warned that demonstrations across the country may mean states will rethink their ability to lend help. That could be especially dangerous at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hamstrung the city’s emergency response teams. On average, the D.C. fire department is operating with a 10 percent reduction in staffing from coronavirus infection and exposure.”Bowser banned indoor dining and forced museums to remain closed until two days after the inauguration, a fiat intended to both curb the pandemic’s spread but also make Washington less hospitable to visitors.

(The Washington Post)Biden scrambles to prevent impeachment from hampering his first 100 days.The president-elect called the Senate parliamentarian on Monday to ask whether the chamber could simultaneously hold a trial of Trump and pass urgently needed bills for covid relief. Biden told reporters in Delaware that he asked about how to “bifurcate” the schedule so that his nominees can get confirmed and bills can advance during a morning session before the trial proceeds in the afternoon. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) explored other, little-used ways of speeding up Senate action. “Some officials who have been involved in past impeachment proceedings said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to bifurcate the Senate’s work as Biden has proposed,” Seung Min Kim, Annie Linskey and Dawsey report. “There could be further delays if legal challenges are mounted to determine whether a former president can face impeachment. And Senate Republicans would have little incentive to work with Biden to speed things along and enact his agenda. All those factors are putting enormous pressure on Schumer to decide how to negotiate the political crosscurrents. He said in an interview published Monday that he considered impeaching Trump and executing Biden’s agenda equally important. …“The Senate is not scheduled to come into session until Jan. 19 … That has prompted Schumer to explore an obscure authority that would allow him, along with the current majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to jointly reconvene the Senate in cases of emergency … But McConnell would have to agree to such a maneuver, and it is far from clear that he would. Aides to McConnell — who had ignored Trump’s calls before Wednesday’s siege and now has no plans to call him back, according to one official — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. …“Over the weekend, Schumer quietly advised his fellow Senate Democrats not to take the prospect of impeachment off the table in their interviews and public comments … In addition, Schumer told senators not to float censure as a potential option for punishing Trump, since most Democrats believe that would let Republicans off the hook by providing a way for them to impose a toothless penalty on Trump. … Biden and Pelosi discussed impeachment when they spoke Friday, and Biden suggested he was agnostic on whether lawmakers go forward.”Democratic control of the Senate will allow repeals of last-minute Trump policies.The Trump “administration put out three to four times its usual volume of rules in recent months, according to estimates by Daniel Pérez, an analyst at George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center,” the WSJ reports. “Such measures, known as midnight regulations, are often vulnerable to rollback by an incoming administration of the opposing party. Agency heads appointed by a new president can scrap rules that have been finalized but not yet published in the Federal Register or delay implementation of ones that have been published but haven’t taken effect. And they can decline to defend rules challenged in court. But control of both chambers of Congress by the president’s party unlocks an additional tool. The Congressional Review Act, or CRA, allows the Senate and House of Representatives to overturn regulations finalized by the executive branch in the previous 60 legislative days using a fast-track process that requires a simple majority vote. Most other legislation requires 60 votes to clear the Senate.\"Biden has said little publicly about his criminal justice plans. “Many say that the credibility Biden earned among civil rights leaders as vice president to Barack Obama, combined with his long-standing ties with law enforcement, including his work on the 1994 crime bill, make him well-positioned to bridge divides among law enforcement officials and civilians pushing for change,” per Tim Craig, Mark Berman, Amy Wang, Tom Jackman, Matt Zapotosky, Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and Justin Jouvenal.The Biden Justice Department is likely to increase resources for the civil rights division and resume wide-ranging scrutiny of troubled police departments nationwide. (Zapotosky) Biden will be the nation’s most pro-LGBTQ president ever and promises an ambitious slate of actions that will go beyond merely reversing Trump’s discriminatory policies.

(Jouvenal)Biden could oversee broad changes in federal drug policy, including how law enforcement agencies view drug addiction and classify the use of marijuana. (Craig)Doug Emhoff, the incoming second gentleman, is stepping away from legal work.“Political spouses seldom cause a ripple, but sometimes they can be a liability,\" Manuel Roig-Franzia reports. \"Emhoff presented a more complex set of questions. Over the years, alongside the boilerplate corporate and real estate work, [the lawyer] has sometimes represented heavily regulated companies or firms that might be frowned upon on the left. … The cases that have gotten the most attention lately, though, have been the quirkiest. He succeeded in shielding an advertising agency from paying a massive judgment in a case involving the origins of the Chihuahua featured in Taco Bell advertisements. … The closest parallel for Emhoff may be Marilyn Quayle, the wife of President George H.W. Bush’s vice president, Dan Quayle. She made inquiries about resuming her legal career when her husband took office, but her plans fizzled amid conflict-of-interest sniping and reluctance within firms to open themselves to undue scrutiny.\"The coronavirusThree House Democrats who tested positive for covid blame GOP colleagues who refused to wear masks.Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) prepared for the worst after she was forced to take shelter last week for several hours in a crowded committee room. Many of the GOP members of Congress hiding out with her were not wearing masks, she said, and had refused to accept them from a colleague. After Congress voted to affirm Biden's victory, she began to quarantine. Sure enough, Jayapal announced late Monday that she has tested positive, joining Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.). A third lawmaker, Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), said Tuesday morning that he, too, had tested positive after spending “several hours in a secure but confined location with dozens of other Members of Congress.”The Trump administration will announce sweeping changes to its vaccination rollout.New guidelines will make many more doses of the coronavirus vaccine available and urge states to provide shots to anyone 65 years old and older. The changes come days after Biden announced plans to release nearly all the vaccine supply. “The Trump administration has been holding back roughly half the vaccines to ensure sufficient supply for people to get a required second shot. But in draft remarks prepared for a scheduled call Tuesday afternoon with governors and obtained by The Washington Post, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar disclosed the change in plans,” Lena Sun and Laurie McGinley report.The FDA cycled through three top lawyers Monday in a clash with HHS. “The unusual sequence began with Trump appointee Stacy Cline Amin abruptly stepping down as chief counsel and the FDA announcing that career civil servant Mark Raza would be her acting replacement. Then, HHS on Monday night announced that Trump political appointee James Lawrence would instead serve as chief counsel — a move that unnerved health officials as the Trump administration heads into its final week. Two officials said that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows backed Lawrence as FDA's top lawyer, per Politico. “Three FDA officials said they were bracing for HHS to push through additional last-minute policy changes, noting that HHS on Monday announced new deregulatory policies that were partly steered by Lawrence. The moves, which roll back some of FDA's reviews, were opposed by the agency and its allies.”The CDC says there’s no sign of a homegrown U.S. virus variant. “Infectious-disease experts say there is no evidence the massive winter surge that is killing thousands of people a day in the United States is linked to the U.K. variant or to a homegrown strain. But they acknowledge their battlefield awareness is limited,” Joel Achenbach, Kim Bellware and Hamza Shaban report. “Some states have minimal capacity to conduct genomic sequencing that allows scientists to trace the random mutations that could give a virus variant some advantage over other strains. Like any virus, this one mutates randomly, and countless variants are in circulation. The increase in the rate of new infections in the United States has been so rapid in recent weeks that scientists cannot rule out the possibility that an undetected variant is accelerating the spread. Other factors may be behind the surge, including holiday gatherings and the lack of adherence in some communities to public health guidelines designed to limit transmission, such as social distancing and wearing masks. … “Nearly 198,000 new coronavirus cases and more than 1,600 deaths were reported Monday in the United States. The seven-day running average for daily deaths has topped 3,200. Nearly 375,000 people have died of the virus in the nation since the beginning of the pandemic. … The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday its strain surveillance program and its partners are on track to more than double by week’s end the number of genomic sequences being uploaded to public databases compared with the sequencing rate in December.\" The District and much of Virginia moved into their next phases of vaccinations, targeting older residents and other vulnerable populations.

He is the first and so far only GOP senator to be unequivocally open to convicting the president. Sasse, a sometime Trump critic who strongly denounced the president’s baseless post-election claims, just won another six-year term.Lisa Murkowski of Alaska: “I want him out. I want him to resign. He has caused enough damage,” Murkowski said in the days after the invasion. She is up for reelection next year, but Murkowski has more electoral flexibility than other Republican senators because her state recently approved new voting rules that minimize the impact of a primary challenge from the right.Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania: “I do think the president committed impeachable offenses,” he said, calling on he president to resign. But he also expressed hesitation that impeachment was the right move with just a few days to go in Trump’s presidency. Toomey is retiring.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMitt Romney (Utah) was the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump during his last impeachment trial, over the president’s pressure campaign on Ukraine, but it’s not clear what he would do if faced with another impeachment vote. Romney issued a short statement Monday to the Salt Lake Tribune that didn’t mention impeachment but suggested he wanted to hold Trump accountable somehow: “When the president incites an attack against Congress, there must be a meaningful consequence. We will be considering those options and the best course for our nation in the days ahead.”The senators who say impeachment is a bad ideaYou could arguably put Toomey in this camp, who has said: “I don’t know whether, logistically, it’s actually really even possible or practical, and I’m not sure it’s desirable to attempt to force him out, what a day or two or three prior to the day on which he’s going to be finished anyway.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSame with Romney. He has also expressed hesitation over impeachment, telling reporters hours after the invasion he didn’t think it was realistic: “I think we’ve got to hold our breath for the next 20 days.”And one of Trump’s biggest Capitol Hill allies echoed what Trump’s House Republican supporters have been arguing, that impeachment is too divisive to undertake. “I think letting the president stew in his own juices is probably the right way to go here,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told The Washington Post after meeting with Trump for four hours. “Impeachment is going to reignite the problem, and we’ve got nine days to go here. It will do more harm than good, and I’m hoping that people on our side will see it that way.”The silent crowdThis is pretty much everyone else. It includes the most important Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who has gone silent, even to Trump. My Post colleagues report that McConnell has ignored the president’s phone calls before and after the siege of the Capitol.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the New York Times reports that, on the eve of House Democrats’ impeachment vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said privately he’s pleased Democrats are moving forward with impeachment and that he thinks it will help purge Trump from the party. The Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker have reported McConnell is furious with Trump but that he doesn’t plan to try to convince Senate Republicans to vote one way or the other on impeachment. McConnell has expressed none of this publicly. If he wanted to, he could bring the Senate back in session for a trial before Democrats take power on Jan. 20. But he hasn’t, and it remains to be seen if a proposed effort by the incoming Senate majority leader, Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), to force the Senate back under McConnell’s leadership would work.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHere’s more about how a second impeachment would work.Sen.

        "article": "After rioters stormed the Capitol less than a week ago after being egged on by President Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, deep questions about the future of the Republican Party and its attractiveness to voters have surfaced.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightSome Republican lawmakers eyeing the 2024 presidential race are now being partly blamed for the GOP’s unpopularity with many of the voters who voted blue in the 2020 election — including by some Republicans.Michael Steele, the former Republican National Committee chairman who has been a critic of Trump, and the GOP for supporting him, shared his thoughts on the future of the party in the most recent episode of “The Next Four Years,” an Amazon original podcast examining the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and what it means for the immediate future. I followed up with him about where the Republican Party goes from here after many party leaders — including the president — led hundreds to violently attack the government of the United States.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementEugene Scott: What’s the future of the GOP after last week’s riots?Steele: There’s an enormous question mark from my perspective. People are so fixated on justifying the words and the deeds that they have committed themselves to long before Donald Trump. I mean, even when going back to my chairmanship, when you try to change the system for the better, you realize that there is a greater resistance inside the structure itself, and people find ways to justify not making that change. What is so stunning for me is how quickly and easily folks just flipped the script from the things they knew and the things they reportedly believed to embrace Trumpism. So it was a battle for folks like me to try to move the party into the 21st century on issues around race and expanding the party and things like that. But then Trump comes along and they were like, ‘Oh yeah, we’ll do white nationalism.’ And then you realized that, well, maybe this is where they’ve always been. And this was not as great of a leap as many may believe. So that complicates the question about the future of the party, because we’ve been trying to answer that question since Ronald Reagan left office in 1989.Scott: The GOP has lost the White House, the House and the Senate. What message do the Republicans need to take from this?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSteele: You will not be a governing majority again as long as you’re embracing Trumpism and nationalism. They are synonymous, and nobody in this country is going to be fooled by that going forward. On our (MSNBC) programs, I said depending on the action taken by Republicans in the Senate, that the Republican Party would wind up sealing itself in the tomb Donald Trump built for it. And on Jan. 6, the Republican Party not only sealed itself inside its own tomb but made it very difficult to get out at some point in the future. Because they are now recognized as a party that has emboldened the overthrow of our constitutional government. And you don’t get to just walk that back.On the podcast, Steele talked about the relationship between Trump and his supporters over the past four years that got them to this point. The president was able to connect with his supporters’ emotions — some of them understandable, but Trump did not channel their anger into anything meaningfully productive.You’ve got people who are just angry and frustrated because for years they’ve been taken for granted. And Trump tapped into that, that passion, that anger, that frustration, and he used it. He, he plucked at it. It’s like an old scab. You just kind of go back at it and you, and you know, you shouldn’t prick at it, but you do and you just, and it starts to bleed. And then you’re like, you try to let it heal and you pick, so he did that repetitive over and over again. Action. And people responded to that, because he became, in many respects, an avatar for them, and he became a way of expressing their frustration and their anger. So it is true. Trump is not the problem. He’s the symptom.The GOP has become so closely aligned with Trump and his worldview that it will be difficult communicating to voters ahead of the 2022 midterms what the party is actually about, Steele said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Republican Party didn’t run on anything except supporting the personality of Donald Trump, Steele said. That wasn’t a winning formula in 2020 and it won’t be moving forward — especially with the Black and Latino voters that proved to be so decisive in states like Arizona and Georgia, he said.They’re not gonna take the White House at 2024. Who’s voting for them? Where do you, how do you get 8 million more votes four years from now? If Donald Trump is still sitting there on the sidelines, bringing in everything that you do. I mean Republicans right now can’t even say the damn election is over and that they lost and Joe Biden is the next president without fear of the ire of Donald Trump. So how do they then go into our community and the Black community? Into Hispanic communities or any community and go, “Just ignore the last four years. That we’re just, we were just kidding. You know, don’t tell Trump, I said that.\" I mean, you know this idea that it all just suddenly, like, cleanses itself and goes away and we start fresh in two years in the ’22 cycle in four years in 24, it’s not happening. Donald Trump won’t let it happen. Leadership requires trust and it starts by you trusting the American people. Right. And the way you demonstrate that trust is how you lead them.What the GOP does from this point as their party leader is facing impeachment days before his successor is sworn in is still unclear. More Republican lawmakers have spoken out against the actions of Trump’s supporters than many people on both sides of the aisle expected given the past four years.But to Steele’s point, how they respond to Trump himself will be definitive as the president remains popular with his base. Trump still had a job approval rating of more than 70 percent with Republicans after last week’s insurrection, according to the Quinnipiac University poll.",

But host George Stephanopoulos first had to ask him about the big issue roiling Washington: President Trump’s alleged incitement of an attempted insurrection against the American government and the attempts to remove him from office that have followed.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAzar was asked twice whether he felt Trump was able to discharge the duties of the presidency — the threshold for Cabinet members invoking the 25th Amendment to remove a president. Azar offered a general denunciation of the rhetoric that led to the scenes (without attaching it to Trump) and declined to talk about the 25th Amendment, citing a blanket policy against disclosing internal discussions.Most telling, though, was what he also declined to say: that Trump is indeed capable of discharging the duties of his office. The question was posed twice, and one of Trump’s own Cabinet secretaries wouldn’t say that he was.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement.@GStephanopoulos: Do you believe what the president did last week showed that he is able to discharge the duties of his office or not? @SecAzar: The rhetoric last week was unacceptable.

Most times, they’ll decline to directly criticize the president. But just as important is how often they’ll decline to actually defend him. Saying a president can discharge the duties of his office is a very low bar, but Azar wasn’t even willing to say Trump clears it.The noncommittal answer is a case-in-point for how gingerly Trump’s allies are confronting the situation since Wednesday’s siege. While they downplayed the severity of Trump’s actions both when it came to obstructing the Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to his impeachment, they’ve spent precious little time assuring that the president’s conduct in this case wasn’t awful.Trump assured Tuesday that “people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” but almost no Republicans are actually saying that.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRather than saying impeachment isn’t warranted and engaging on the substance of it, in fact, they’ve instead pivoted to saying it would prevent the country from unifying (despite having failed to offer similar cautions about Trump trying to overturn an American election in the first place). While denouncing the rhetoric that preceded the siege, they’ve generally spoken about it in broad terms, declining to litigate how much blame Trump’s rhetoric, specifically, deserves or whether he’s actually guilty of incitement.Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) was among the earliest proponents of the it’s-time-to-unify-instead argument, tweeting that those calling for impeachment “are themselves engaging in intemperate and inflammatory language and calling for action that is equally irresponsible and could well incite further violence.”Those calling for impeachment or invoking the 25th Amendment in response to President Trump’s rhetoric this week are themselves engaging in intemperate and inflammatory language and calling for action that is equally irresponsible and could well incite further violence.— Rep. Kevin Brady (@RepKevinBrady) January 10, 2021 Brady was castigated by the left for the tweet. But it includes a pretty notable implication: Trump himself was also engaging in such irresponsible rhetoric that might have incited violence. Brady, though, didn’t dwell upon that point.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reportedly told GOP colleagues Monday in a phone call that Trump bears some blame for what happened last week, but he has not said that publicly. And before the call, he sent a missive laying out several options — a censure resolution, a bipartisan commission, changes to election laws, and legislation to “promote voter confidence” in elections — without addressing Trump’s actions specifically.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has echoed the idea that there was irresponsible rhetoric but that impeachment and other punishments would be counterproductive. He said President-elect Joe “Biden has a historic opportunity to unify America behind the sentiment that our political divisions have gone too far.”In a four-minute video posted to his Twitter account, Rubio stressed the need for accountability and figuring out how this happened.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Now, how do we explain this? How could this happen here in America?” Rubio said. He blamed media bias, alleged social media censorship, and how state officials administered elections for fomenting a disbelief in the electoral process. He cited unnamed politicians who he said had lied to those disbelievers about potential remedies such as having Vice President Pence insert himself in the process. But he did nothing to address Trump’s role — either in defense of it or to rebuke it.pic.twitter.com/61TGMPJz0i— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 8, 2021 Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who led the impeachment of President Bill Clinton when he was in the House, has also said impeachment would be counterproductive while declining to defend Trump. When asked last week about other methods for potentially removing Trump, he said of the 25th Amendment: “I do not believe that’s appropriate at this point,” but added later: “Now, if something else happens, all options would be on the table.”The implication, as with Brady’s tweet, is that Trump did do something wrong in the first place and just that it shouldn’t be repeated. Whether that’s impeachable, there would seem to be a discussion worth having about just how wrong it was. Rubio says we need to get to the bottom of how this happened and has gently alluded to the kind of misinformation Trump has shared, but he instead focuses more specific blame on other entities such as the media.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith some notable exceptions, Republicans have steadfastly declined to litigate Trump’s role in any significant measure — either to criticize it or, as notably, to support it. And the thing is, impeachment is a divisive process. But that division must always be measured against the alleged bad deed involved and the need for accountability.Rather than address that balancing act, though, Republicans are pretending one side of the scale isn’t worth weighing.",

        "article": "As of Monday morning, more than 100 hours had passed since a mob of supporters of President Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Wednesday, resulting in five deaths, dozens of injuries among members of law enforcement, an enormous amount of damage to the building and the most significant threat to the elected leadership of the United States in decades.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightOver that period, the scale of what had occurred had become increasingly clear. Capitol Police officers were, in places, overwhelmed by the sheer number of rioters. Video clips emerged showing the brutality of the attacks on police officers, one of whom died of his injuries. Various rumors about those present had arisen and already been debunked.One of those debunked theories was that two men present at the riot were associated with the left-wing ideology of antifa, a decentralized network of activists that has at times used violence in opposition to right-wing actors. An article in the conservative Washington Times, since retracted, claimed that two men pictured in the Capitol were linked to antifa. They weren’t. But the article said precisely what many Trump allies wanted to hear — the worst aspects of the day were not the fault of Trump’s side — so the claim quickly permeated conservative media, including Fox News, and was elevated by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) as he voted to reject the certification from states that supported President-elect Joe Biden.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAll of that was last week, though. Again, by Monday morning, the reality was clear: The violence was pro-Trump, not some false-flag effort by Trump’s opponents. Yet, according to Axios, that’s precisely the claim that Trump  made in a call with the highest-ranking Republican in the House.“In a tense, 30-minute-plus phone call . . . with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Trump trotted out the Antifa line,” Axios’s Jonathan Swan reported. “McCarthy would have none of it, telling the president: ‘It’s not Antifa, it’s MAGA. I know. I was there,’ according to a White House official and another source familiar with the call.”McCarthy is clearly correct. The Washington Post and Reuters tracked down other online rumors of antifa presence at the Capitol, finding no evidence to support the claims. The FBI told reporters that there was “no indication” of antifa presence. Trump supporters who celebrated the action were quick to insist that they were the ones who deserved the credit.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne of those arrested, Terry Brown of Pennsylvania, described the scene inside the building.“There were probably 2,000 to 3,000 people in there at any given time,” he said, according to the Lebanon Daily News. “There were a bunch of garbage cans they threw down the steps . . . and people stopped and they were yelling ‘we’re not Antifa.’ ”Yet Trump insists they were. There are probably at least two reasons he does so.The first is that he has repeatedly tried to position antifa as a violent threat to the United States for months. Over the course of the 2020 campaign, Trump tried to use antifa as a foil, a frightening vision of what the United States would become should he lose his reelection bid. When protests focused on police brutality at times devolved into vandalism and violence in the spring, Trump repeatedly claimed that antifa was at fault — and, by extension, left-wing politics.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut that, too, was false. The violence during that period was not a function of antifa, according to a Post review of arrest records. The administration kept trying to pin the most dangerous acts of that period on antifa, but the identified suspects kept not being associated with antifa.Behind the scenes, government experts were identifying other more dangerous groups. In September, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned that the most significant lethal threat came from self-proclaimed white supremacist groups — groups that were in obvious attendance last week. (A government whistleblower alleged shortly before that in testimony that the risk posed by self-identified white nationalists had been downplayed within DHS in favor of elevating antifa.) The Capitol riot was also well-populated with adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which was included in a May 2019 warning from the FBI about the rise of “conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists.”The other reason Trump probably ascribed the violence to antifa was encapsulated in a quote from an administration official reported by The Post last week.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“He kept saying: ‘The vast majority of them are peaceful. What about the riots this summer? What about the other side? No one cared when they were rioting. My people are peaceful. My people aren’t thugs,’ ” the official said. “He didn’t want to condemn his people.”The central refrain — “we aren’t antifa” — echoes the chants Brown heard in the crowd. But that little addition about Trump’s people not being “thugs” gives away the subtext.Trump has used the term “thug” repeatedly as president, generally in reference to his political opponents and often when those opponents are or are perceived to be non-White.“Weakness will never beat anarchists, looters or thugs,” Trump tweeted shortly after protests began in May, “and Joe [Biden] has been politically weak all of his life. LAW & ORDER!”Story continues below advertisement“They are not ‘peaceful protesters,’ as [Biden] and the Democrats call them, they are THUGS — And it is all taking place in Democrat run cities,” Trump said of protesters in September. “Call me and request Federal HELP. We will solve your problems in a matter of minutes.”AdvertisementThe thugs are those on the left who use violence as part of their protests. His supporters aren’t thugs; ergo, someone else must have been at fault for the violence. This is, of course, in keeping with Trump’s long-standing view of the criminal spectrum in the United States, from insisting that his allies deserve pardons after being caught committing crimes by then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to claiming that police need to crack down more forcefully on immigrant criminals and left-wing protesters. That this often overlaps with the racial spectrum is not a coincidence.There is a third possible explanation for Trump’s claim to McCarthy that antifa was involved: He hoped that McCarthy, like some of his least reality-adherent supporters, would simply accept his claim at face value. That McCarthy would simply default to the assumption that it was The Others who were misbehaving, not his own side.Story continues below advertisementWhile McCarthy has broadly supported Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential contest, he — reportedly — put his foot down on this one point in his conversation with Trump on Monday. In fact, the crowd reflected precisely the ideologies that Trump’s administration had been warning about for months: far-right and fringe extremists.It is not hard to figure out why Trump would want to downplay that.",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAlso, a number of readers asked whether they had missed an edition of the newsletter Sunday. They didn't. The 2020 campaign is over, the 2021 campaign is just getting underway, so we're moving to two days a week. We'll be in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.History will record that two states faced formal challenges to their 2020 presidential election results. When the certification began last week, Arizona Republicans led the House objection against their state’s electors. Hours later, after the crowds and dead bodies were cleared out of the Capitol, most Pennsylvania Republicans did the same.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut those states were supposed to have company. And even as they've called for “unity” in the wake of the siege, Republican leaders have argued that serious questions remain about the 2020 election, the challenges meant to bring them to light, and how states conduct elections in the future.“Once the thing is certified in Congress, then, of course, Biden is the winner,” said Steve Pearce, the reelected chairman of the New Mexico Republican Party, which sent its own slate of electors to Washington. “But there are questions that were asked multiple times and never got addressed. And that's unfortunate, because it leaves too many questions hanging in the air. Elections are not where you want questions hanging in the air.”That attitude is reflected in conversations with party activists across the country. A number of high-profile Republicans have condemned the president, with a coalition of #NeverTrump conservatives promising $50 million to defend Republicans who vote to impeach. On Tuesday, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming became the first Republican in party leadership to support impeachment. This hasn't trickled down to local Republican activists. They had questions about whether the election was fair, and now those asking those questions are being, in the already-tired terminology of 2021, canceled. They had questions about whether the election was fair, and now those asking those questions are being, in the already-tired terminology of 2021, canceled.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The president didn’t make ‘baseless claims,’ he made claims based on affidavits from eyewitnesses,” said Tina Dziuk, a Republican National Committeewoman from New Mexico who previously led the party in rural Roosevelt County. “I supported allowing 10 days of investigation. If enough evidence of fraud had been committed, then there would have been a remedy for that by sending it back to the states.”House Republicans knew this. When they said their constituents were demanding that they question the election results, they were telling the truth. The president exists in a seamless loop with conservative media, as displayed at his first rally in Georgia for two Senate runoffs that his party would lose. With thousands of voters watching, and hundreds of reporters, Trump repeatedly stepped back to watch allegations of election fraud, made on the pro-Trump network One America News, replace the names of the Senate candidates on the rally's big screen.Republicans would eventually (and anonymously) say the president's electoral obsession weakened the campaigns of Sen. David Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler. But the senators leaned into that strategy— both had called for Georgia's Republican secretary of state to resign without ever explaining what he allegedly did wrong. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut Republican voters listened to President Trump, and on the ground the anger at election officials for allowing a Democratic win was palpable. Decades of Republican fears that big cities produced fake Democratic votes blended easily with the president's lifelong habit of suing until he got his way or exhausted his options. The fear of the steal ran so deep that this week, long after the Senate races were decided, one conservative Georgia county conducted its own audit of the vote to \"restore public confidence in our election process.\" And the state's Republican-majority legislature is already considering whether to end no-excuse absentee voting for future elections, making ballot access slightly harder in the interest of calming angry voters.A number of House and Senate Republicans who supported the Jan. 6 certification have urged their voters to move on. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who narrowly unseated a moderate Democrat to win her Charleston-area district, told the National Journal this week that the election challenges were ruses to “raise money for a super PAC or somebody's future election.” And there are Republicans who voted the other way who quietly agree.The president, however, has refused to say the election was conducted fairly, refused to concede, and will be the first president since Reconstruction not to attend the inauguration of his successor. This is what the Republican base plainly wants him to do. In public polling, even since Jan. 6, less than a third of self-identified Republicans have said that the election results were valid. New Mexico's only Republican member of Congress, Rep. Yvette Herrell, used two of her first votes to reject the Arizona and Pennsylvania certifications, which was the state GOP's position ahead of the vote.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The unconstitutional election changes in numerous states disenfranchised my constituents in New Mexico,” Herrell said on Facebook, adding that the lack of a senator's objection prevented a challenge to her own state's electors. “I hope that by joining so many of my House colleagues in objecting we can shed light on the problems with the 2020 election and move towards solutions that restore integrity and confidence to our electoral system.”As they charge toward impeachment, Democrats and a few Republicans hope that their actions can remove the president from political life. There is some demand for this from donors, but nearly none from rank-and-file Republicans. In New Mexico, where the current political alignment looks bad for Republicans, the president did help Herrell win a House seat. Asked whether they would want the president to help his party in 2022 or in special elections, Republicans here said that they would.“The president brought many first-time and ‘walk away’ voters into the party,” Dziuk said. “I would like to see him work to encourage those voters to stay active and involved in the issues they care about.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPearce, who was a member of Congress for the first two years of Trump's term, also suggested that the president could continue to help his party. He rattled off a list of accomplishments, from a growing pre-coronavirus economy, to the 2017 tax cut, to “holding our trading partners accountable.\" “I know that the people who support the president support him 100 percent,” Pearce said. \"The president did a remarkable job of bringing new people into the party.

Take the Trump/Republican money chase, which was relentless even after the president lost reelection. One week ago, the day of Georgia's runoffs, the Trump campaign texted supporters three times asking for help. Shortly after 11 a.m. on Jan. 6, it once again asked for donations to help the president overturn his defeat.“Pres Trump: TODAY is critical in our efforts to DEFEND the Election!” the text read. “I need YOU to be 1 of the Patriots who FOUGHT BACK! 1000% IMPACT! Act NOW.” Six days later, that remains the last fundraising text from the Trump campaign.AdvertisementHouse Republicans are also far less certain about how to handle an impeachment focused on something specific and lived-through: The president's role in the riots. Officially, the House GOP's leadership team is not whipping amid expectations that some members will vote with the Democrats. Around a third of their membership opposed decertifying the electors from Pennsylvania and Arizona; a smaller subset of those Republicans have not ruled out impeachment. Democrats are also proceeding as if they have the votes to impeach, which they likely do. In 2019, just three Democrats balked at the two articles of impeachment that grew out of the president's effort to get political dirt on Joe Biden by pressuring Ukraine's new president. One of those Democrats, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, lost reelection last year. Another, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, voted “present” on both articles, easing their passage without supporting them; she retired at the end of the last Congress. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine supported just one of the two articles, obstruction of justice.Gabbard was a gadfly; Golden had specific reasons for his vote that don't apply to a vote tomorrow. And as this newsletter has pointed out before, the 2020 elections put Republicans back in power across the reddest districts held by Republicans. No incumbent Democrat has as many Trump voters in his district as Peterson did.\n\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoll watchDo you think that President Trump is undermining or protecting democracy? (Quinnipiac, 1,239 registered voters)Undermining: 60%Protecting: 34%Most national pollsters had a rough 2020. Quinnipiac was among them, finding rosier-than-reality numbers for Joe Biden in key states, missing some of the trends that held the president's base together. But Quinnipiac never found Trump as low as it does here, with 33 percent approval, easily the worst rating of his presidency. It's still better than George W. Bush fared on his way into retirement, because most of the president's supporters have stuck with him; 73 percent of Republicans say the president was trying to uphold democracy last week, along with 47 percent of White voters with college degrees.How much do you think President Trump is to blame for what happened at the U.S. Capitol? (PBS NewsHour/Marist, 875 adults)A great deal: 51%A good amount: 13%Not very much: 10%Not at all: 25%Here's another way of looking at the president's most dogged supporters and how they're processing last week's attack on the Capitol. Overwhelmingly, but not entirely, Republicans oppose the aftermath of the “Stop the Steal” rally, but 18 percent of them say they supported it. A majority of Republicans, 51 percent, say the president is “not at all” responsible for what happened on Jan. 6; that number rises to 67 percent among adults who say they do not trust the results of the 2020 president election. By a 45-point margin, voters in big cities say that Trump is definitely to blame for the riots; by a 6-point margin, rural voters say he isn't.Do you approve of the way Donald Trump and Joe Biden are handling their jobs? (Reuters/Ipsos, 1,133 registered voters)Donald TrumpApprove: 40% (-2) Disapprove: 58% (+2)Joe BidenApprove: 57%Disapprove: 38%Republicans arguing that another presidential impeachment would divide the country have one advantage: The president's support remains largely unmovable, and he is set to end his presidency with an average approval rating in the high 30s. But if that was enough to win an election, the president would be starting a second term next week. It isn't. While upward of 90 percent of Democrats approve of Biden's transition and about the same percentage of Republicans approve of Trump, just 9 percent of Democrats and 31 percent of independents approve of the exiting administration. Biden will begin his term with broader support, with 21 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of independents backing Biden's performance in the ill-defined role of “president-elect.”In the statesTwo of Bernie Sanders's best-known swing state endorsers have gotten a boost in their races for congressional seats.Nina Turner, the former Ohio state senator who co-chaired Sanders's 2020 campaign, was one of the first Democrats to enter the race to replace Rep. Marcia Fudge. She got a boost Monday with the official endorsement of Justice Democrats, the group founded after 2016 to elect more left-wing members of Congress. “We know Senator Turner will help create a mission-driven team in Congress to deliver relief during this pandemic and fight for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, and getting big money out of politics,” Justice Democrats wrote in a fundraising message to its supporters. “Nina Turner will join the Squad in fighting for policies that match the scale of the crises we face.”Turner has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her campaign. According to Justice Democrats, the endorsement netted her $23,000 in 24 hours, surpassing their initial $20,000 goal. The race does not begin in earnest until Fudge resigns her seat to become HUD secretary in the Biden administration.Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who had a smaller role than Turner in the last Sanders campaign, launched an exploratory committee for a Senate bid this week, quickly raising $500,000 — including, he claimed, donations from all but four of Pennsylvania's counties. “You responded in a way that I just couldn't have ever possibly imagined,” Fetterman said in a video message, alongside his wife Gisele. That likely wasn't hyperbole: Fetterman ran for the party's Senate nomination in 2016 and raised less than $760,000 for his entire primary. He was the odd man out in that race, as national Democrats poured in help for Katie McGinty, who would go on to lose narrowly to Sen. Pat Toomey.Fetterman and Pennsylvania Democrats got more good news on Tuesday when a federal judge sided with them, allowing ballots in a razor-thin state Senate race near Pittsburgh to be counted. Republicans, who had lost at state court, argued that ballots that were not dated properly by Westmoreland County officials should be tossed; had they been, Democratic Sen. Jim Brewster would have been denied another term. Their refusal to seat Brewster last week led to a vote to remove Fetterman, the Senate's president, during the swearing-in of new members. That incident helped boost Fetterman's profile with state and national Democrats, who had already begun to treat the lieutenant governor like a star after his punditry and updates during the challenges to Pennsylvania's presidential vote.In the statesAfter the 2012 election, Republican legislators in swing states debated whether to split up their electoral votes, arguing the winner-take-all system unfairly advantaged Democrats in big cities. After 2016, when Donald Trump narrowly carried Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the push to divvy up electoral votes was halted. You'll never guess what happened after 2020.In Michigan and Wisconsin, prominent Republicans have again suggested moving to a congressional district-based system of assigning electoral votes, arguing that it would end the tyranny of big-city voters. “If Michigan were to end the winner take all system of electoral college votes and instead break it up by congressional district, it would make campaigning in our state much more balanced,” Michigan Rep. Bill Huizenga wrote on Facebook. “This would remove Detroit’s outsized influence and encourage candidates to compete for votes in each congressional district across the entire state, not just the big cities.” Separately, in Wisconsin, a Republican state legislator has resurrected an old effort to split up the state's eight electors by the winner of each district.Right now, just Maine and Nebraska split up their electors this way, affecting five total votes in the electoral college. (Each state also assigns two electors to the statewide winner.) And the chatter about splitting up electors to help rural Republicans had advantages after 2012 that it lacks now. At that time, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had Republican governors who could have signed off on these changes. In 2021, all three states have veto-happy Democratic governors, and Michigan is about to undergo its first redistricting with a voter-approved independent commission. In 2013, it had been more than two decades since Republicans were able to win any of these states; in 2021, their memories of watching each state go red remain fresh. What looked in 2013 like an insurmountable Democratic lead from Detroit or Milwaukee or Pennsylvania now looks like a lead that can be overwhelmed with a big enough rural vote for the GOP. But the mythology of the elector split hasn't changed. Huizenga, who represents a deep red slice of western Michigan, is only the latest Republican to argue that the winner-take-all system discourages candidates from stumping outside metro Detroit. Leave aside the uniqueness of 2020 — Joe Biden barely set foot in Michigan — and the argument is still waylaid by reality. Under the winner-take-all arrangement, investing in Michigan netted Biden 16 electoral votes. Had the electors been split up by district, he'd have netted zero: Six for the districts he carried, and two for winning statewide, a function of a Republican-drawn map that packed most Democratic voters into a smaller number of seats.Republicans don't have the numbers to change the electoral vote laws in any of these states. But Trump's own victories outside of cities and suburbs, and his obsession with the amount of red on a county-by-county map, have recharged some of the Republican enthusiasm for taking lean-Democratic states off the map by splitting their electors.Countdown… eight days until the inauguration… 147 days until New Jersey's and Virginia's primaries… 161 days until New York's primary",

        "article": "There’s a remarkable consistency in how President Trump and many of his allies view the eruption of political violence: It is always Trump’s opponents who are responsible for what happened.The deaths that occurred at the Capitol last week were not, as Trump reportedly told a senior Republican official, a function of left-wing actors riling up the crowd. They were, instead, a function of anger about the results of the 2020 presidential election — anger stoked by Trump over the past two months as he’s lied about the election being stolen from him. Trump tossed new lies about an unprecedented usurpation of American democracy into an already roiling pool of conspiracy theorists and acolytes in an effort to usurp democracy. Thousands of his followers heeded his explicit message and tried to stop Congress from doing what American voters had asked it to do.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightYet, because those rioters were acting on behalf of Trump and, by extension, conservative and right-wing politics, their actions have been excused as an understandable response to the imaginary crisis Trump has touted. There was a spate of responses to the storming of the Capitol that came in the form of “violence is bad, but” — with the “but” generally referring to concerns about election security (concerns amplified and exaggerated by Trump) or about other Democratic actions. With new threats reportedly looming in Washington, Trump’s allies have begun suggesting that Democrats bear the blame for any future violence, as well.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We see what’s happening around this country, how 50 statehouses are being threatened on Inauguration Day,” “Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade said on Tuesday morning. Referring to one of those reported threats, he said that “this is the last thing you want to do” — that is, impeach Trump for his role in what happened at the Capitol.One can certainly argue about the utility of impeaching Trump. What one can’t do in good faith, though, is suggest that if there are attacks at statehouses later this month, it’s a direct function of that impeachment. After all, the threats already exist! The anger is already there! An attempt to institute repercussions for deliberately encouraging that anger is not the proximate cause for the anger.Kilmeade, himself angry, continued to rail at the idea that Trump should be impeached.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It would be as dumb as Nancy Pelosi hopping on ’60 Minutes’ last night,” he later added, referring to a segment Sunday night, “and saying the president is an imminent threat and has to be derailed.”This has been an undercurrent to the push to impeach or remove Trump from office: that he might continue to use his platform to explicitly or tacitly encourage the sort of threats demonstrated at the Capitol on Jan. 6. His removal from Twitter on Friday certainly limited the reach of such entreaties, as did the revocation of access to other Internet-based communication tools. But on Tuesday, addressing reporters as he prepared to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border for an event, he sought to rationalize the anger at his political opponents.Like a teenager who sees one episode of “Law & Order” and comes to believe that police officers have to identify themselves, Trump interlaced his rhetoric with insistences that he opposed violence.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“As far as this is concerned,” he said in reference to the Capitol events before boarding Marine One at the White House, “we want no violence, never violence. We want absolutely no violence.”Then the pivot.“And on the impeachment, it’s really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics,” he said. “It’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous. This impeachment is causing tremendous anger. And you’re doing it. And it’s really a terrible thing that they’re doing. For Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger. I want no violence.”Story continues below advertisementGot that? The danger and anger that exist moving forward are being caused by the reaction to what occurred last week, not as a continuation of the fury that led to Trump’s supporters storming the Capitol.AdvertisementThat Trump frames this as a continuation of the “witch hunt” — a by now sweeping reference to every time Democrats have sought to investigate Trump’s behavior or otherwise hold him to account — makes clear that he understands what the real source of the anger is. Trump ran in 2016 as an opponent of the Democratic left and managed his presidency largely through the lens of goading or frustrating progressives and his political opponents. Every question about his campaign or his tenure, from his campaign’s contacts with Russian actors in the 2016 election to attempting to leverage the United States’ relationship with Ukraine in hopes of influencing the 2020 contest, is positioned as Democratic partisanship run amok. Trump has accrued five years of grievances against his opponents, which culminated in his false claims that Democrats stole the election from him — and which, when pushed up against the wall of his defeat being formalized, erupted into the violent invasion of the seat of the country’s legislature.After Marine One landed at Joint Base Andrews, Trump continued to press his case that it was everyone else who was amplifying the danger of the moment. The technology companies who shut off his access, for example, were causing “a lot of problems and a lot of danger.”Story continues below advertisementThen another shift to defend his and his supporters’ actions on Jan. 6.Advertisement“You have to always avoid violence,” he said. “And we have — we have tremendous support. We have support probably like nobody’s ever seen before. Always have to avoid violence.”Who was fomenting violence? Why, the left, of course.“If you read my speech — and many people have done it, and I’ve seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television — it’s been analyzed and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” Trump said of his comments at a rally shortly before the Capitol was stormed. “And if you look at what other people have said, politicians, on a high level, about the riots, during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places, that was a real problem, what they said. But they’ve analyzed my speech and my words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody to the T thought it was totally appropriate.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump has apparently internalized the idea that suggestions that he bears responsibility for what happened at the Capitol stem largely from what he said that morning. The article of impeachment, which is likely to come to a vote in the House on Wednesday, does identify that speech as an incitement for insurrection. But it puts his remarks that morning in the context of two months of falsehoods about the sanctity of the election itself, remarks that led thousands of Trump supporters to go to Washington in the first place.“Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,” he claimed — falsely — in a tweet on Dec. 18. “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”Regardless of whether Trump’s words on the morning of Jan. 6 spurred the rioters to attack the Capitol, the rioters were unquestionably there because of Trump’s words before that point.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt’s not clear what Trump’s referring to when he asserts that “other people” said things that were the “real problem” in advance of the violence following protests over the summer. It is clearly the case, though, that what happened at the Capitol was of much higher importance and at a much different scale than what happened over the summer — even if his assertions about incitement by his opponents were accurate. Last Wednesday, hundreds or thousands of people misled about the 2020 election injured numerous law enforcement officials as they tried to physically interrupt the final confirmation of Trump’s electoral loss. One injured police officer later died.What Trump said on Tuesday was an effort, however nonsensical, to redirect blame for what happened that day toward his opponents. It was an attempt to rationalize as acceptable what happened and his role in it. It was interlaced with “no violence” insistences, statements that may well be sincere in their intent. But his comments were a reinforcement of the idea that his people were doing something justified and justifiable and that, should they again get out of hand, it’s not his fault but his opponents’.The president lied about losing the election for two months, and his supporters, conditioned to believe him, came to Washington to prevent the election from being “stolen.” By framing what ensued as part of a years-long effort to reduce his power, he simply reinforced the perceived scale of the fight. By refusing to explicitly denounce those who raided the Capitol (beyond in the most vague terms) and by refusing to acknowledge his own role, he again promoted the idea that the bad actors were the ones trying to introduce accountability for what occurred.Every American should hope that no further violence occurs. If it does, we should be clear-eyed about who encouraged it and how.",

        "article": "The Democratic-led House voted late Tuesday to officially call on Vice President Pence to remove President Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment, rebuffing the vice president’s objections. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Pence had urged Congress “to avoid actions that would further divide and inflame the passions of the moment.” The House proceeded with the vote and is on course to consider impeaching Trump on Wednesday on one charge, “incitement of insurrection,” days after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.Four Republicans have said they would vote to impeach Trump, including Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), No. 3 Republican in the House, who said there has “never been a greater betrayal” by a president to his office and his oath to the Constitution.Trump called the effort by House Democrats to impeach him for a second time a “witch hunt” and offered no regrets for inciting the mob attack on the Capitol last week as he emerged from seclusion Tuesday to travel to Alamo, Tex., to tour a section of the border wall.Here’s what to know:Rep. Bradley Schneider (D-Ill.) has become the third lawmaker to announce a positive test for the novel coronavirus after sheltering at close quarters with dozens of members of Congress during last week’s takeover of the Capitol.The attack on the Capitol has done little to upend Biden’s preparations for the beginning of his administration Jan. 20, for the worst of reasons: It is only one of several calamities that the new president and his administration will confront when he takes office.The House’s acting sergeant at arms installed metal detectors outside the chamber in the wake of the Capitol riot, requiring all individuals to undergo security screening. Those who refuse to be screened or who are carrying prohibited items could be denied access to the chamber.Several U.S. Capitol Police officers have been suspended and more than a dozen others are under investigation for suspected involvement in or inappropriate support for the demonstration last week that turned into a deadly riot at the Capitol.Here are the nominees Biden has picked to fill his Cabinet.House votes to officially call on Pence to remove Trump by invoking 25th AmendmentBy Felicia Sonmez4:29 a.m.Link copiedlinkThe House on Tuesday voted to formally urge Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment against President Trump, the chamber’s first step toward seeking to hold the president accountable for last week’s violent siege of the Capitol.The vote was 223-205. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) joined Democrats in voting for the resolution.Pence had informed the House he would not take such a step, calling it too divisive and saying “now is the time to heal.” Under the 25th Amendment, Pence could deem Trump unfit for office and wrest control before the end of the president’s term.The House is poised to move ahead on impeaching Trump on one charge: “Incitement of insurrection.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementRep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) will vote to impeach TrumpBy Mike DeBonis3:11 a.m.Link copiedlinkRep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) became the fourth Republican to say he will vote to impeach President Trump.Upton, a moderate elected to his 18th term last year, underscored that Trump called his words last week as “totally appropriate” Tuesday and offered no contrition for the violent attack on the Capitol despite instigating the mob.“This sends exactly the wrong signal to those of us who support the very core of our democratic principles and took a solemn oath to the Constitution. I would have preferred a bipartisan, formal censure rather than a drawn-out impeachment process,” Upton said in a statement. “But it is time to say: Enough is enough. The Congress must hold President Trump to account and send a clear message that our country cannot and will not tolerate any effort by any President to impede the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next. Thus, I will vote to impeach.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementRep. Raskin says Capitol rioters desecrated ‘temple of democracy'By Felicia Sonmez2:57 a.m.Link copiedlinkThe Democratic-led House ultimately voted on Jan. 12 to officially call on Vice President Pence to remove President Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment. (The Washington Post)Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager, opened Tuesday night’s debate on his resolution to urge Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump by outlining in vivid detail the actions of the rioters who violently stormed the Capitol last week.“They allowed hundreds or thousands of people to enter the Capitol without metal detector or any kind of security screening at all, not only to desecrate the temple of democracy and to spit in the face of Congress, but actually to interfere with the counting of electoral college votes in the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said.“They may have been looking for Vice President Pence and Speaker Pelosi, but every person in this room could have died. As a shaken senator, Lindsey Graham, said: ‘The mob could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all.’ ”Rep. Tom McClintock rose to respond for the Republicans. He was wearing a black face mask bearing the message, “This Mask is USELESS.”McClintock accused Democrats of “committing directly the same offense” that they are accusing Trump of committing indirectly — misusing the Constitution — by pressing for the invocation of the 25th Amendment.The Republican from California also argued that Trump “never suggested rampaging the Capitol and disrupting the Congress.” He warned that if Congress proceeds with taking up “this new role as armchair psychiatrists and a new power to equate intemperate speech with functional disability, the most important pillars of our government’s stability — the rule of law and the separation of powers — will fracture.”“It won’t affect this president,” McClintock said. “But it will stalk future presidents from this day forward. For their sake, please don’t do this.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) echoed Raskin’s language, accusing Trump of inciting “a deadly insurrection against America that targets the very heart of our democracy — this temple of democracy, the United States Capitol.”“The gleeful desecration of the Capitol and the violence against Congress, our staff and our workers are horrors that will forever stain our nation’s history,” she said.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementIn bike ride around the Capitol, Rep. Quigley realized authorities weren’t prepared to repel mob attackBy Karoun Demirjian2:27 a.m.Link copiedlinkRep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) a member of the House Intelligence Committee, could tell the night before a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol that authorities weren’t prepared for what was about to happen.Quigley, who often trades in his suit to bike home in jeans, took a turn around the Capitol grounds and was struck by the conversations he casually overheard.“The night before [the riots], I rode my bike around the Hill. You could hear these people talking. A fool could have had anybody in plain clothes walking around and realize they’re not here for tea,” Quigley said in an interview. “And then the morning of, I did the same thing — the crowds were bigger, they’re angrier.”He said he called his chief of staff and said they didn’t have enough security.“Even if I couldn’t hear them, you could sense this was ugly and tense. But you could hear them,” Quigley said of the rioters, and he offered a sobering prediction.“This will get worse,” he said, noting that as the rioters said, last week was “a dress rehearsal.”Just before the mob stormed the Capitol, Quigley had made his way from the House floor to the gallery, unwittingly walking into the most dangerous area — where lawmakers were left to fend for themselves as the crowds attempted to push into the chamber, without the protective Capitol Police presence that existed on the House floor. He found himself crouched near Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) a new congresswoman from Southern California with whom he had been chatting in the opening days of Congress, showing her the ropes. Now, they were both fiddling with gas masks, trying to get them unfolded and on.They weren’t sure whether the protesters outside had guns, and they feared that the chamber might be breached at any second. So Quigley, a noted jokester, turned to Jacobs to try to make her smile.“Aside from this, how was your first day in Congress?” he asked.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementHouse Republicans disregard metal detectors to keep guns off House floorBy Karoun Demirjian and Felicia Sonmez2:08 a.m.Link copiedlinkA group of House Republicans pushed past newly installed magnetometers put in place to keep firearms out of the House chamber, after one gun-rights activist appeared to set off a metal detector but refused a subsequent bag search.Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who came under fire during Wednesday’s riot for tweeting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had been removed from the chamber, was seen by photographers around the House chamber refusing to allow Capitol Police to inspect her bag.Boebert is a vocal gun-rights activist who has promised to carry her Glock on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol and in Washington. While firearms are allowed in House offices, they cannot be brought onto the House floor.Following the apparent altercation with Boebert, several more House Republicans were seen walking around the magnetometers, pushing their way past security and striding onto the floor for a vote that was underway.It wasn’t just reporters who noticed the GOP members breaking the new rules about entry onto the House floor. Other members began reporting on the actions of their more reckless colleagues as well.“Rep. Van Taylor is in front of me as I’m trying to go in to vote, refusing to pass through a metal detector and arguing with U.S. Capitol Police officers about it,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said of the Texas Republican in a tweet.“Do these people not understand that literally everyone else has to go through metal detectors to get in here?” Beyer continued. “Average people do not get to bring guns into the United States Capitol in normal times. Get over yourselves.”Later Tuesday night, Boebert defended her actions in a tweet.“I am legally permitted to carry my firearm in Washington, D.C. and within the Capitol complex,” she said. “Metal detectors outside of the House would not have stopped the violence we saw last week — it’s just another political stunt by Speaker Pelosi.”Acting House sergeant at arms Timothy Blodgett informed House members of the new screening procedures in a letter hours earlier.“Magnetometers are being placed at selected entrances to the Chamber,” Blodgett said in the letter. “Failure to complete screening or the carrying of prohibited items could result in denial of access to the Chamber.”He also reminded lawmakers that “pursuant to the firearms regulations that Members received on opening day, firearms are restricted to a Member’s Office.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementU.S. attorney in Georgia: ‘There’s just nothing to’ claims of election fraudBy Amy Gardner and Matt Zapotosky2:01 a.m.Link copiedlinkThe acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, whose predecessor abruptly resigned one week ago after President Trump complained officials were not doing enough to find election fraud in the state, declared on a call with his staff Monday that “there’s just nothing” to the few claims of fraud the office was examining, according to an audio recording obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.On the call, Bobby Christine, who kept his previous job as top federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Georgia, also suggested that he was surprised to learn the office had not found significant election fraud problems.“Quite frankly, just watching television, you would assume that you got election cases stacked from the floor to the ceiling,” Christine said, according to the Atlanta newspaper. “I am so happy to find out that’s not the case, but I didn’t know coming in.”Read the full storyarrow-rightAdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementThe lockdown room was a safe space for lawmakers under siege. Now some say maskless Republicans made it a coronavirus hot spot.By Colby Itkowitz1:58 a.m.Link copiedlinkAs the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol last week, House members and some staff sheltered in a cramped, windowless room with no more than an arm’s length of distance between them.The group seemed safe from the violence raging nearby, but inside they faced another threat. Several Republican members hunkered down, maskless, refusing to use the face coverings that their Democratic colleagues and staffers were begging them to wear as protection from the coronavirus that thrives in such low-ventilation indoor environments.One Democrat, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), grew so angry that she left the secure room, concluding, according to an aide, that “we’re not going to survive a terrorist attack to be exposed to a deadly virus.”But many stayed behind — and some now think they were exposed. Nearly a week after the riot, three Democratic lawmakers who had sheltered in that room, including Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a 75-year-old cancer survivor, have tested positive for the coronavirus.Read the full storyarrow-rightAdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementBacklash to riot at Capitol hobbles Trump’s business as banks, partners flee the brandBy Josh Dawsey, David  Fahrenthold and Jonathan O'Connell1:50 a.m.Link copiedlinkIn November — as President Trump began his effort to overturn the election he had lost — his longtime friend Tom Barrack called him with advice: Stop, for the sake of your business.The Trump Organization was already struggling, hurt by political backlash and coronavirus-related closures, facing huge unpaid loans. Barrack told Trump that he could help that business — as well as his aides, and the country itself — by ensuring a peaceful transition, according to person familiar with the conversation.An “elegant” exit, Barrack said, could preclude what could be a painful future: millions of dollars in legal costs, rampant investigations and more boycotts of his businesses.Trump did not follow Barrack’s advice.Now, the Trump Organization is facing the consequences: In the past week, it has lost a bank, an e-commerce platform and the privilege of hosting a world-famous golf tournament, and its hopes of hosting another have been dashed. In the future, the Trump Organization also could lose its D.C. hotel and even its children’s carousel in Central Park, if government landlords in Washington and New York reevaluate their contracts with Trump.Read the story here.

Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), one of the lawmakers leading the effort, said in a statement that the move is intended as an alternative to impeachment.“Both Democrat and Republican Members of the U.S. Senate are convinced that the House’s impeachment efforts will almost certainly result in a second acquittal of President Trump, which would even further divide and inflame tensions in our nation,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement.“There are two constitutional purposes of impeachment: 1) removal from office, and 2) barring the future holding of office. The current approach being advanced by House leadership is certain to accomplish neither one of these,” he added.The resolution would affirm Biden’s victory and state that Trump “has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.” It also would censure and condemn Trump “for trying to unlawfully overturn the 2020 Presidential election and violating his oath of office on January 6, 2021.”The other Republicans joining Fitzpatrick in introducing the measure are Reps.

The Senate is in recess until Jan. 19 and a trial likely wouldn’t begin until Trump is out of office.“Tonight, I have the solemn privilege of naming the Managers of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump,” Pelosi said. “It is their constitutional and patriotic duty to present the case for the President’s impeachment and removal. They will do so guided by their great love of country, determination to protect our democracy and loyalty to our oath to the Constitution.”Pelosi tapped the following managers: Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin (Md.), Diana DeGette (Colo.), David N. Cicilline (R.I.), Joaquin Castro (Tex.), Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Ted Lieu (Calif.), Del.

Liz Cheney’s historic decision Tuesday to vote to impeach President Trump had its roots in a dramatic phone call from her fatherBy Michael Kranish1:10 a.m.Link copiedlinkRep. Liz Cheney’s historic decision Tuesday to vote to impeach President Trump had its roots in a dramatic phone call from her father, former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who was watching events unfold on television last week and warned that she was being verbally attacked by the president.Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking member of the House Republican leadership, became the most prominent congressional Republican to call for Trump’s impeachment. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” Cheney said in a statement. “I will vote to impeach the president.”Six days earlier, Cheney was in the House chamber, urging that Republicans reject efforts pushed by Trump and many in her party to challenge the electoral college results that had determined Trump had lost his reelection bid. She did not know that she was being attacked by Trump, who was delivering the speech that would incite a mob to storm the Capitol, until her father reached her by phone in the House cloakroom.Read the full storyarrow-rightIn letter to Pelosi, Pence says he does not support invoking 25th Amendment to remove TrumpBy Felicia Sonmez12:59 a.m.Link copiedlinkPence sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday night in which he declared his opposition to invoking the 25th Amendment to relieve Trump of his official duties.“I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution,” Pence wrote in the letter.Pence cited his rejection last week of Trump’s efforts to pressure him to unilaterally overturn Biden’s win, suggesting that Pelosi’s request — like the president’s — was a step too far.“Last week, I did not yield to pressure to exert power beyond my constitutional authority to determine the outcome of the election, and I will not now yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a time so serious in the life of our Nation,” Pence said in the letter.Trump defiant and unapologetic about his role in inciting Capitol mob attackBy Philip Rucker and Josh Dawsey12:43 a.m.Link copiedlinkALAMO, Tex. — President Trump emerged Tuesday from six days out of public view defiant and unapologetic about his incitement of last week's mob attack on the Capitol and warned that his impeachment could lead to more violence.The president denied any culpability in the violent riot that killed a police officer and threatened the lives of Vice President Pence and members of Congress. He said his remarks encouraging throngs of supporters last Wednesday to march to the Capitol in a show of force to pressure and intimidate lawmakers to overturn the election results were “totally appropriate.”During a visit to a portion of newly constructed border wall here in the Rio Grande Valley, Trump warned against the effort in Congress to hold him accountable.“The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the U.S.A., especially at this very tender time,” Trump said.Read the full storyarrow-rightImpeachment ‘is not a punishment of prior wrongs, but a protection against future evils,’ House Judiciary Democrats sayBy Felicia Sonmez12:29 a.m.Link copiedlinkThe House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday released a majority staff report on Trump’s impeachment ahead of the chamber’s debate on voting for a second time to remove the 45th president from office.In its 74-page report, staff for the panel’s Democratic majority lay out their argument for how Trump’s conduct “satisfies the standard for high Crimes and Misdemeanors,” describing the president as “a clear and present danger to the Constitution and our democracy.”“Impeachment is not a punishment of prior wrongs, but a protection against future evils,” the report says. “It is true that the President’s remaining term is limited — but a President capable of fomenting violent insurrection in the Capitol is capable of greater dangers still.”The report calls on members of the House to “reject this outrageous attempt to overturn the election and this incitement of violence by a sitting president against his own government.”“President Trump committed a high Crime and Misdemeanor against the Nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election,” it continues. “The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump.”",

        "article": "with Mariana AlfaroNo matter how you look at her decision, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) supporting the impeachment of President Trump took immense political courage. A new CBS-YouGov poll shows 55 percent of Americans favor impeachment, but just 15 percent of Republicans do. In November, the president carried her state with 70 percent of the vote. The leader of the Freedom Caucus and other Trump loyalists quickly called for Cheney’s ouster as the No. 3 in House GOP leadership. The No. 1 and No. 2 on the leadership team oppose impeachment. The single article that has been introduced, for “incitement of insurrection,” already had the support of 218 House Democrats, enough to ensure its passage without her walking the plank. Even if no action is taken, Trump will be out of the White House in seven days.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightTaken together, these factors make the statement Cheney issued Tuesday all the more remarkable. The 54-year-old has offered perhaps the most forceful and eloquent case of any lawmaker in either party for removing Trump from office over his behavior last week.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough,” Cheney wrote. “The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.”During a Monday evening conference call with Republicans, Cheney hinted at where she was heading. “This is going to be a vote of conscience,” the congresswoman told the members, according to two people who were on the private call.Cheney’s decision had its roots in a dramatic phone call from her father, Dick Cheney, who was watching events unfold on television last Wednesday. The former vice president called to warn her that the president had criticized her by name during his speech on the Ellipse, Michael Kranish reports. “We got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world,” Trump told the crowd that would soon storm the Capitol. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCheney’s announcement has created a permission structure for other members to follow her lead. Four other House Republicans announced Tuesday that they will vote to impeach Trump when the vote comes up on the floor later today. Here are the rationales they have offered in their statements:“To allow the President of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy. For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action,” wrote Rep. John Katko (N.Y.), the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and a former federal prosecutor. “It cannot be ignored that President Trump encouraged this insurrection – both on social media ahead of January 6th, and in his speech that day. By deliberately promoting baseless theories suggesting the election was somehow stolen, the president created a combustible environment of misinformation, disenfranchisement, and division. When this manifested in violent acts on January 6th, he refused to promptly and forcefully call it off, putting countless lives in danger. …“The divide in our country is more clear than ever before,” Katko added. “I hear my Republican colleagues in their argument that impeachment only further divides our country at a time when we must move forward. I agree. There must be a continuance of government and a peaceful transition of power. But I also believe firmly that I must follow the law and the facts and hold this President accountable for his actions.”President Trump on Jan. 12 said calls to invoke the 25th Amendment would “come back to haunt” President-elect Joe Biden. (The Washington Post)Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) complained that Trump showed no contrition when he spoke on Tuesday and described his speech from last week’s rally on the Ellipse as “totally appropriate.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“He expressed no regrets for last week’s violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol,” Upton wrote. “This sends exactly the wrong signal to those of us who support the very core of our democratic principles and took a solemn oath to the Constitution. I would have preferred a bipartisan, formal censure rather than a drawn-out impeachment process. I fear this will now interfere with important legislative business and a new Biden Administration. But it is time to say: Enough is enough. The Congress must hold President Trump to account and send a clear message that our country cannot and will not tolerate any effort by any President to impede the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next.”Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) wondered: “If these actions – the Article II branch inciting a deadly insurrection against the Article I branch – are not worthy of impeachment, then what is an impeachable offense?”“We are in unchartered waters here, and in a moment in history we have not experienced in modern times,” Kinzinger wrote. “There is no doubt in my mind that the President of the United States broke his oath of office and incited this insurrection. He used his position in the Executive to attack the Legislative.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) faulted the president for not just inciting the mob but saying kind words about those who stormed the Capitol:This is already a significant shift from December 2019 when Democrats impeached Trump on a party line vote for urging Ukraine to announce investigations into Joe Biden and his son. “A senior administration official said the White House expects at least a dozen Republicans to support impeachment in the likely House vote Wednesday. The White House is rudderless, unwilling or unable to mount any defense other than saying that Trump will already be leaving next week,” Mike DeBonis, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report. “Trump, banned from Twitter, for the first time lacks the ability to aim angry tweets at those who oppose him, and White House officials conceded that he has few ways to stem the tide. …“Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been telling associates since the attack that Trump probably committed impeachable offenses, as first reported by the New York Times. McConnell, a close adviser said, has not decided how he will vote on impeachment and wants to hear the case first. McConnell has not returned Trump’s calls in weeks and remains livid with him, and he will not pressure his colleagues to oppose or support convicting the president. “He’s not going to whip the vote,” said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. A McConnell spokesman declined to comment.”Constitutional law professor Jared Carter of Vermont Law School outlines the lasting legal ramifications of impeaching President Trump for a second time. (The Washington Post)On Tuesday night, the House passed a resolution on a 223-to-205 vote calling on Vice President Pence and the Cabinet to use their powers under the 25th Amendment to remove Trump immediately. They did so despite Pence sending an open letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) saying that he would not invoke the 25th. “Last week, I did not yield to pressure to exert power beyond my constitutional authority to determine the outcome of the election,” Pence wrote in the letter, “and I will not now yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a time so serious in the life of our Nation.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPelosi signaled her confidence that the impeachment resolution will pass by announcing the nine Democratic “managers” who will serve prosecutors during the second Senate impeachment trial. The group will be led by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). The others will be Reps. Diana DeGette (Colo.), David Cicilline (R.I.), Joaquin Castro (Texas), Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Ted Lieu (Calif.), Stacey Plaskett (V.I.), Joe Neguse (Colo.) and Madeleine Dean (Pa.).Five moderate House Republicans have publicly endorsed censure as an alternative to impeachment, but there is little appetite for this among Democrats. The group, led by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), introduced a censure resolution that criticized Trump fort trying to “unlawfully overturn” the election. The other Republicans who signed onto this measure are Reps. Young Kim (Calif.), John Curtis (Utah) and Peter Meijer (Mich.). Upton also joined the group, but a few hours later came out for impeachment. “Both Democrat and Republican Members of the U.S. Senate are convinced that the House’s impeachment efforts will almost certainly result in a second acquittal of President Trump, which would even further divide and inflame tensions in our nation,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “There are two constitutional purposes of impeachment: 1) removal from office, and 2) barring the future holding of office. The current approach being advanced by House leadership is certain to accomplish neither one of these.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTune in for The Washington Post’s live coverage of the proceedings.

Pompeo also reportedly planned to visit Luxembourg on Thursday, but the meeting fell through after the country’s foreign minister called Trump a “political pyromaniac” and a “criminal” for inciting the rioters. (John Hudson)The FBI warned of a “war” at the Capitol in advance of the mayhem.“A day before rioters stormed Congress, an FBI office in Virginia issued an explicit warning that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and ‘war,’ according to an internal document reviewed by The Post that contradicts a senior official’s declaration the bureau had no intelligence indicating anyone at last week’s demonstrations in support of Trump planned to do harm,” Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report. “A situational information report approved for release the day before the U.S. Capitol riot painted a dire portrait of dangerous plans, including individuals sharing a map of the complex’s tunnels, and possible rally points for would-be conspirators to meet in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and South Carolina and head in groups to Washington. … Yet even with that information in hand, the report’s unidentified author expressed concern that the FBI might be encroaching on free-speech rights. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement\"The warning is the starkest evidence yet of the sizable intelligence failure … The head of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, Steven D’Antuono, told reporters on Friday that the agency did not have intelligence suggesting the pro-Trump rally would be anything more than a lawful demonstration. … Steven Sund, who resigned as Capitol Police chief, said in an interview Tuesday that he never received nor was made aware of the FBI’s field bulletin.” The Justice Department creates a sedition and conspiracy task force to bring rioters to justice.“The investigation, one of the largest ever undertaken by the department, includes counterterrorism and counterintelligence facets and has led to charges against more than 70 people and identified 170 suspects to date, acting U.S. attorney Michael R.

Those arrest figures are expected to increase into the hundreds, if not ‘exponentially,’” Spencer Hsu, Keith Alexander and Shayna Jacobs report. “But Sherwin and [D’Antuono] said any impression that prosecutors have mostly charged misdemeanor Capitol trespassing and D.C. curfew offenses is misleading. They said the cases are only the beginning and that U.S. authorities are investigating everything including the plundering of congressional offices and digital devices, assaults on law enforcement officers, and theft of national security and defense information, in addition to felony murder and excessive use of force. ‘The gamut of cases is mind-blowing,’ Sherwin said. … Capitol and D.C. police were in openhanded combat with rioters, tear gas was used against police, and destructive devices and semiautomatic weapons have been recovered, he said. … A new grand jury was empaneled Friday and met Monday to hear new Capitol breach cases.

She was part of the group that tried to disenfranchise millions of voters from Pennsylvania and Arizona even after the insurrection. Kennedy School Dean Doug Elmendorf said in a letter to the Harvard community: “Elise has made public assertions about voter fraud in November’s presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect.

Including both those groups immediately adds another 100 million people [potentially] seeking shots, bringing the total to about 184 million and intensifying demand on already stressed sign-up systems,\" Lena Sun and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. \"The Trump administration also said Tuesday it would begin releasing all available vaccine supply, rather than holding back second doses, as the incoming administration said last week it intended to do.” Biden’s team also briefed Congress on his emerging covid relief plan. “The proposal, which Biden intends to unveil on Thursday, is expected to include $2,000 stimulus payments, an extension of enhanced unemployment insurance, money for vaccine distribution and delivery, funding for cities, states, schools, child care and more,” Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. “Transition officials indicated in meetings with Democratic staffers that Biden will try to get bipartisan support for the measure, instead of using a special budgetary tool [called reconciliation] that could allow him to push legislation through Congress with only Democratic votes … That’s led to speculation that the price tag of the package could be below $2 trillion — although Biden said last week that it could cost in the multiple trillions of dollars. … Biden’s unveiling of the package is likely to kick off a furious round of lobbying and horse-trading as numerous lawmakers push for their priorities in the legislation.”With her members still fuming that Republicans refused to wear masks while they were sheltering in place, Pelosi announced that anyone not wearing a mask on the House floor will be fined $500 for their first offense and $2,500 for their second.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightPresident-elect Joe Biden will make combatting climate change a top priority, calling it “an existential threat.\" But in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said it would be a mistake for the incoming administration to concentrate on climate change to the exclusion of other environmental priorities. “I hope that they aren't as single-focused — the Biden administration — as the Obama administration was,” said Wheeler, who has highlighted marine litter, getting lead out of the nation’s water supply and cleanup of Superfund sites during his tenure. Biden has picked North Carolina regulator Michael S. Regan to succeed him.Wheeler's advice to Regan: “I hope that he’s going to look at broader issues.”While Biden’s proposals include taking on a litany of environmental ills, the new president is unlikely to take advice on climate change from Wheeler, who has overseen some of the most significant of the more than 125 rollbacks of environmental regulations undertaken during the Trump administration.  AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn Tuesday’s interview, Wheeler embraced that record, dismissing the well-documented criticisms from environmental advocates that President Trump has presided over an assault on environmental safeguards, Obama-era efforts to curb climate change and the work of agency scientists.  “I think we have proven that you can reduce pollution and have cost-effective regulations,” he said.  Wheeler said that he made the agency more efficient during his two and-a-half years at its helm. He has run the agency since July 2018, after Trump’s first EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, stepped down amid a series of ethics scandals. The agency is set to unveil Pruitt’s official portrait Friday.Story continues below advertisementMany career EPA employees, public health groups and Democrats have criticized Wheeler for his approach to regulating pollutants and weighing scientific evidence in policymaking. But he emphasized that the agency had eliminated a backlog of 125 Clean Water Act permits and cut the bottleneck of pending state plans aimed at improving air quality by more than half.Advertisement“We’ve put in place efficiency changes in the agency that will last a generation,” he said. “This agency is stronger than it’s ever been.” Wheeler expressed hope the incoming administration would “build off” some of the Trump administration’s work, even as Biden has already pledged to reverse many of its most significant policies. Story continues below advertisementWhile the president-elect has pledged to impose stricter tailpipe emissions on cars and light trucks, for example, Wheeler said the administration was justified in weakening them because the auto industry “still aren’t meeting the Obama standard.” Data released by the EPA last week showed the U.S. auto fleet’s average fuel efficiency in 2020 actually declined for the first time in five years. Under the standards adopted under Obama, overall gas mileage was set to increase by 5 percent annually through Model Year 2025. Wheeler says he is not leaving his post after the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Wheeler acknowledged in the interview that some of his allies had urged him to resign over Trump’s role in the violence that took place at the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. The heads of EPA’s policy and legislative affairs offices, both Trump appointees who had worked on the Hill, quit in protest on Monday. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“I was actually in Costa Rica and only saw the footage of what went on in the Capitol,” said Wheeler, who called into a senior staff meeting Thursday morning when his top aides debated whether to step down. Asked whether he thought the president incited the violent incident, Wheeler said, “And at this point, I know all that’s being investigated, by Congress, and even the U.S. attorney has referenced that. So I think it would be inappropriate to comment on the instigation for what happened Wednesday.”“I was completely disgusted by what happened Wednesday,” he added, but said he ultimately decided he would not follow fellow Cabinet members such as Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos out the door. “I took an oath of office, and I believe I owe an obligation to the agency and the American public. We still have work to do.” Wheeler declined to say what might lie ahead for him — outside of home improvement projects. “After being in this job for almost three years, I have let so much go around my house,” he said. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWheeler began his career as an EPA employee before working in the Senate and as a lobbyist for coal companies and other clients. Before taking a job in the Trump administration, Wheeler worked for the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels.He had planned to travel to Australia for a month-and-a-half after his tenure ended. “Unfortunately, you know, travel’s out of the question now.”So after years of what allies and critics alike would agree was an unrelenting push to carry out Trump’s agenda, he plans to merely take a breath. “I’m in no rush to jump into anything else,” he said, adding, “I am honestly exhausted.” Power playsRick Snyder will face criminal charges in Flint water crisis.The former Michigan governor is expected to be charged alongside several other ex-officials for his role in the 2014 Flint water crisis, according to a report by the Associated Press. The crisis, which started when the city switched its water supply to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure, left at least a dozen dead from a Legionnaire's outbreak and harmed the health of many more residents in the predominantly Black city, our colleagues Kim Bellware and Brady Dennis write. The office of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel notified Snyder, his former health department director Nick Lyon and former adviser Rich Baird of pending indictments, the Associated Press reported, citing unnamed sources. Nessel's office declined to provide comment on the probe or provide information about the nature of the charges.Mona Hanna-Attisha, whose research in 2015 first documented dangerously high lead levels in children’s blood in the city, described the charges as a crucial step toward justice.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“As a pediatrician privileged to care for our Flint children, I have increasingly come to understand that accountability and justice are critical to health & recovery,” Hanna-Attisha told The Post in a text message Tuesday. “Without justice, it’s impossible to heal the scars of the crisis.”Trump appointees published controversial climate papers without approval.David Legates and Ryan Maue, senior officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), were reassigned after they published papers questioning the seriousness of climate change without White House approval, our colleagues Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow report.“The papers include the claim that subscribing to the idea of human-caused global warming ‘involves a large measure of faith’ and that computer models are ‘too small and slow’ to produce meaningful climate simulations,” Freedman and Samenow write.Legates and Made had been detailed to the White House since November and their papers bear the imprint of the Executive Office. But the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Kelvin Droegemeier, never approved their publication. Their dismissal from the White House office means that they will return to NOAA for their final days working for the Trump administration. NOAA also disavowed the papers and said that the agency was not involved in their creation or posting.A new EPA rule sharply limits new regulations on industrial pollution.The new rule prohibits future regulations on any source whose industry-wide emissions account for less than 3 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This would effectively exclude every stationary polluter besides power plants, Politico reports.“The rule comes just eight days before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has pledged a multitrillion-dollar initiative that would combat climate change by making sharp cuts in the United States' carbon dioxide pollution,” Politico writes. “The new regulation could hamstring much of that agenda, for example by prohibiting Biden's EPA from setting carbon limits on oil and gas wells or refineries.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe rule was included as part of a long-planned, much narrower regulation aimed at easing greenhouse gas limits for future coal plants. The agency did not seek public comment on the proposal to exempt large swaths of industry from future regulations, potentially imperiling the rule in court challenges.United Airlines aims to suck carbon out of the skies.The airline is the first major U.S. carrier to back carbon capture, our colleague Steven Mufson reports. The company will invest millions of dollars in a venture that will pull carbon out of the air. “United is increasingly focused on its voluntary goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 — good publicity at a time of growing alarm about climate change,” Mufson writes. “But it may also be placing an early bet that carbon capture technology could — with the help of federal tax credits — prove profitable as the globe races for ways to cut the pollution that threatens the planet.”The allure of carbon capture may be particularly appealing for the aviation industry. The industry account for 3.5 percent of the planet's greenhouse gases each year, and there are few low-carbon alternatives in commercial aviation.United will partner with 1PointFive, a joint venture designed to finance and deploy a large-scale direct air capture plan. The company, which gets its name from the U.N. goal of limiting average global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, was formed by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum and Rusheen Capital Management. Its first plant will be in the Texas Permian Basin, where Occidental plans to take carbon dioxide from the air and pump it into old wells to extract more oil.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“But extracting more oil from underground doesn’t please climate activists, although the money will help 1PointFive cover Carbon Engineering’s estimated cost of $100 for each ton of carbon dioxide captured,” Mufson writes.Insects face ‘death by a thousand cuts.’A series of papers published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences paint a dire picture for global insect populations, the Guardian reports.“Nature is under siege…[and] most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event,” concludes the lead analysis in the package. “Insects are suffering from ‘death by a thousand cuts.’ ”One study found that butterfly populations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have declined by 50 percent. Still, the picture is complex. Some insect populations have increased, for instance, as global warming leads to milder winters and allows them to expand their range.Meanwhile, some activists are pushing to ramp up protections for one threatened insect. The Center for Biological Diversity has said it intends to sue the Trump administration in an attempt to restore the American burying beetle's endangered species status. U.S. Fish and Wildlife downgraded the beetle's status from endangered to threatened after oil and natural gas companies complained that the insect's protected status was interfering with plans for drilling and laying pipeline.Extra mileageA new group of climate scientists is launching a campaign to engage mothers.Six climate scientists who are also mothers have launched a $10 million campaign to educate and empower other mothers to do something about climate change, our colleague Sarah Kaplan reports.

        "article": "The second impeachment of President Trump was, like the first, largely partisan. Democrats voted to impeach; Republicans opposed it. But that doesn’t fully convey the shift between the impeachment that occurred in 2019 and the one that occurred on Wednesday. That 10 Republicans sided with a unanimous Democratic majority marks a repudiation of historic significance.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightSure, we’re talking about a small sample size here. In U.S. presidential history, there have been only four impeachment efforts, two of which targeted Trump. So describing something as the most bipartisan of four is not incorrect, but it should be considered in the context that this doesn’t happen very often. Or, at least, that it didn’t used to.Nonetheless, that there has been a consistent pattern of a president’s party sticking with him in an impeachment effort makes the defections seen Wednesday stand out. Particularly when considering how much more polarized the House is than it used to be.Let’s consider the three most recent impeachments, that of Bill Clinton in 1998 and those of Trump in 2019 and 2021. Below, we plotted each member of the House relative to how that member’s congressional district voted in the preceding presidential contest (those being the 1996, 2016 and 2020 elections).Setting aside the impeachment issue for a moment, we see first that, in 1998, the dots are all much more clustered around the centerpoint — indicating far more congressional districts in which the 1996 results were not lopsided in one direction or the other. Over the next 20 years, the presidential margins in those districts expanded, a function of both gerrymandering and increased partisanship. This is also a function of how not-close the 1996 election was. Clinton’s rout of former senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) affects the dots’ placement as well.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe dots also show how much more common it was for a member of the House to represent a district that voted for the presidential candidate of the other party. Lots of purple dots — representing the nonpresidential party, or, in 1998, the Republicans — to the left of the centerline. Lots of orange to the right.On the subject of impeachment, though, party makes a big difference. Most of the orange dots above are light in color, meaning they are members of the president’s party who opposed impeachment. Most of the purple dots are dark: members of the opposing party who supported it.If we isolate those members who bucked their parties — members of the opposition who opposed impeachment or members of the president’s party who supported it — things look more interesting. A few defections in 1998, mostly among representatives representing districts that preferred the other party’s presidential candidate. Only two defections in 2019, including then-Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.), who would later become a Republican.And then there’s 2021.In this vote, there were no members of the opposing party who voted against impeachment. There were 10 Republicans who supported it — including five representing districts where Trump was favored by more than 10 points in the presidential race. (For districts where congressional-level data aren’t yet available, we used 2016 values.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe starkest outlier there is Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), part of the House Republican leadership. Her denunciation of Trump’s actions leading up to and during the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week was unflinching, providing fodder for Democrats giving speeches from the House floor as the impeachment vote loomed. She cast Trump’s actions in unusually nonpartisan terms, echoing the extent to which this highly partisan vote was nonetheless less partisan than one might have expected.Another statement, from a district that backed Trump by nearly 20 points, might have stood out even more.On Monday, Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) told a reporter that he would oppose impeaching the president. That position was very much in line with his approach to Trump since day one. When the vote came, though, Rice joined nine of his colleagues in supporting the effort.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It has been a week since so many were injured, the United States Capitol was ransacked, and six people were killed, including two police officers,” Rice said in a statement. “Yet, the President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were ‘perfectly appropriate.’”Those comments, it seems, pushed Rice in the other direction.“I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years,” the statement continued. “I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable.”And with that, Trump was impeached once again.",

        "article": "Hours into the debate over impeaching President Trump for inciting the violence that erupted in Washington last week, Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) stood up to make a point he felt had been overlooked.“I rise with a very simple question,” Mast began. “On Jan. 6, thousands broke the law by taking siege of our Capitol here with us inside. Has any one of those individuals who brought violence on this Capitol been brought here to answer whether they did that because of our president?”Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightHe paused for effect, awaiting an answer he knew would not come.“It appears I will receive no answer,” he said after about 30 seconds. He stepped away from the lectern.Mast’s point was apparently twofold: first, that there had been no witness testimony preceding the impeachment vote and, second, that there was not evidence that Trump’s actions had, in fact, incited the violence that occurred.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe first argument is accurate. The second is debatable.During a speech from outside the White House shortly before the Capitol was overrun, Trump did call on the people in attendance to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol and claimed both that he sought peaceful protest and encouraged his listeners repeatedly to “fight” on his behalf. There has not been documentation that those who were in attendance and entered the Capitol did so explicitly because they felt that Trump wanted them to, but there is documentation that the effort to breach the Capitol began shortly after Trump’s speech concluded.There is also documentation that multiple people who stormed the Capitol were only in Washington because Trump had called for them to be.The best known is Jacob Chansley, or the “QAnon Shaman,” who appeared in the Capitol wearing fur and a hat with horns. When Chansley, who’s been arrested and charged in connection with the riot, was interviewed by the FBI (at his initiation), he told investigators that “he came as a part of a group effort, with other ‘patriots’ from Arizona, at the request of the President that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C. on January 6, 2021.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump made that request repeatedly, including with multiple tweets on Jan. 1. (“January 6th. See you in D.C.,” one said.) His first mention of it on Twitter came on Dec. 19, when he elevated a document alleging rampant voter fraud and told his followers that there would be a “[b]ig protest in D.C. on January 6th.”“Be there,” he added, “will be wild!”How seriously was that taken? One of the people being sought by the FBI for having invaded the Capitol had the phrase emblazoned on a T-shirt as seen in a wanted poster from the Bureau.Brandon Fellows, another rioter who illegally entered the Capitol, told Bloomberg News that he came to Washington specifically because of that tweet.Story continues below advertisement“We were there for one common cause,” Fellows said, “which is making a statement that the government is crushing down on us.”AdvertisementDouglas Sweet, who was arrested and charged with unlawful entry, told the television station WTKR that he went to the Capitol because “Trump asked all the patriots to show up, so I did.”“I didn’t go with any malice or intention of malice of those that committed those the fights — the tear gas and just, you know, throwing stuff at police,” he told the station. “That wasn’t in my game plan at all.”Some Trump allies have speculated that antifa was responsible for inciting violence and storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. No evidence supports this claim. (The Washington Post)One of the more infamous participants during the riot was Larry Brock, who was photographed on the floor of the Senate wearing military gear and holding flex cuffs, a form of zip-tie designed to serve as handcuffs. Brock, who was also arrested and charged in the riot, is an Air Force veteran and spoke with the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow.Story continues below advertisement“The President asked for his supporters to be there to attend, and I felt like it was important, because of how much I love this country, to actually be there,” Brock told Farrow. He also claimed that he “assumed he was welcome to enter the building,” a claim that seems hard to believe given his equipment and the obvious chaos through which he made his way.AdvertisementAgain, none of these individuals is testifying under oath before the House that they were incited specifically to engage in the violent occupation of the Capitol because of Trump. Each of them, though, is saying that they were in Washington because of Trump, and each ended up being part of the crowd that did storm the Capitol.It’s unlikely that this will change Mast’s view of the impeachment effort.",

        "article": "For several days now, the Republican Party’s impeachment defense of President Trump has been marked by a rather notable omission: any real defense of his conduct leading up to the siege of the U.S. Capitol last week.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightRepublicans, rather than defending Trump, have focused on process, arguing that the impeachment was rushed or would only further divide and inflame the country, and pointing to things Democrats have said and the media has done that they suggest demonstrate hypocrisy.That imbalance was particularly pronounced as the House debated his impeachment Wednesday. In fact, there were more Republicans supporting Trump’s impeachment or otherwise rebuking his conduct than actually defending or even litigating it.Story continues below advertisementMost notably, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) became the second top GOP leader in Congress’s two chambers in 24 hours to fault Trump, joining Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who signaled an openness to convicting Trump.AdvertisementMcCarthy opposed impeachment, but said: “That doesn’t mean the president is free from fault. … The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. These facts require immediate action by President Trump to accept his share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest and ensure President-elect Biden is able to successfully begin his term.”McCarthy said he supported a censure resolution against Trump instead.Story continues below advertisementTrump, to this point, hasn’t accepted responsibility. In fact, he said Tuesday that he saw nothing wrong with what he said before his supporters stormed the Capitol.McCarthy’s comments came shortly before another House Republican, Rep. Dan Newhouse (Wash.), announced his support for impeachment. But while others, like McCarthy, stopped short of that, a few others joined him in finding fault.AdvertisementRep. Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.), for instance, suggested Trump had erred in his “judgment.”“I’m not saying the president didn’t exercise poor judgment,” Arrington said. “But to criminalize political speech by blaming lawless acts on the president’s rhetoric is wrong.”Story continues below advertisementRep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) went further, saying Trump had indeed committed impeachable offenses. But Roy said that was not because he incited the attempted insurrection at the Capitol, as the single article of impeachment alleges. Rather, Roy cited Trump’s urging of Vice President Pence to overturn the election, a situation to which Roy objected in real time.“The president of the United States deserves universal condemnation for what was clearly, in my opinion, impeachable conduct: pressuring the vice president to violate his oath to the Constitution to count the electors,” said Roy, who is a former chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who led the effort to overturn the election results in Congress.AdvertisementAs the vote was taking place, Reps. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) and Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) also put out statements rebuking Trump.Story continues below advertisement“I strongly condemn the president’s rhetoric and his behavior,” McCaul said, adding, “Let me also say, there very well may have been impeachable offenses committed leading up to, and on, that tragic day.” McCaul objected to a rushed process, but acknowledged that more could come out about Trump’s actions that might make him regret his decision, saying such things could “put me on the wrong side of this debate.”Crenshaw added that “we condemn the president for the words and actions which contributed to these events, and encourage every member of Congress to similarly condemn.” Crenshaw also said Trump’s “actions were reckless. No President should ever, among other things, promote clearly unconstitutional theories that risk the stability of our nation and, in particular, do so to the detriment of the peaceful transition of power.”AdvertisementAn examination of the developments on the House floor shows there were by comparison few Republicans actually willing to delve into what Trump did and when.Story continues below advertisementRep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) qualified that he didn’t like Trump’s speech. But, somewhat similarly to Roy, he said he was more concerned about Trump suggesting Congress could decline to accept the results of the electoral college. And, like Arrington, he suggested Trump’s words were simply freedom of speech.“If we impeached every politician who gave a fiery speech to a crowd of partisans, this capital would be deserted,” McClintock said. “That’s what the president did. That is all he did.”Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) argued that Trump merely had “political Tourette’s” syndrome, in that he says what’s on his mind without a filter and that last week was no different.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Is he a clear and present danger? He clearly isn’t,” Issa said. “The president has acted substantially the same for four years. He has rallied his base, and he has, in fact, called for peaceful protest, as he did just a few days ago. … What happened last week was the result of anarchists who came loaded, prepared and with weapons.”Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) offered a similar defense.“There was no language in the president’s speech that incited or provoked violence,” Steube said. “In fact, at around the 18-minute mark, he stated and I quote, ‘Peacefully and patriotically, make your voices heard.’ You may think that he’s inciting violence because he believes there is election fraud. That’s his opinion.”Story continues below advertisementThe GOP’s most ready defense of Trump would indeed seem to have been citing this line from Trump’s speech. It was notably surrounded by plenty of other comments that could be read to spur drastic action — and plenty of past comments that suggested violence by his supporters. But even if that line provides some plausible deniability, what was particularly telling Wednesday was how few Republicans even invoked it. Besides another mention by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), it wasn’t really a feature off the defense. And apart from it, there was almost nothing in the way of actually addressing Trump’s culpability or lack thereof.AdvertisementIt sets up an interesting Senate trial, in which Trump’s defense will probably be forced to actually confront what he said and did more directly. But it’s also indicative of the position in which the GOP finds itself politically: It sees actually standing up for Trump as a less-productive response than diverting attention to other things.That might not mean Trump deserves impeachment, but it does indicate how much Republicans have decided they don’t actually want to have that conversation after the ugly scenes last week.",

It would be an even stronger signal if it was the Republican-controlled Senate launching this trial in his final days in office.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFor those reasons, holding a Senate trial in the coming days would be an undeniable humiliation for the president, one that casts a pall on his future political ambitions. (If they were to convict him, the Senate could also take a vote to bar him from ever holding office again. That requires just a majority.)A senior White House adviser, speaking anonymously, described it that way to CNN:This adviser said the current thinking is the Senate does not have enough time to convict Trump before he leaves office, so the president can make it to the end of his term without that kind of humiliation.“We will get through the 20th and move on,” the adviser said.All of this could happen after Trump leaves office — a trial, a bipartisan conviction, a vote to prevent him from holding future office — but Trump’s team clearly sees that as less of a threat.

Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Senate majority leader, is trying to persuade McConnell to bring the Senate back earlier via an infrequently used provision under which both party leaders agree there’s an urgent need to do so, but McConnell hasn’t taken him up on that. In fact, McConnell aides told Schumer aides they wouldn’t reconvene the Senate on Friday when the Senate is scheduled for a pro forma session, The Post reported. That suggests McConnell is not willing to hold a trial under his tenure as majority leader.House Republicans opposed to a second impeachment are seeking to cast Democrats as politically opportunistic, questioning the timing of the impeachment push.“With only a week to go,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said on the House floor on Wednesday as that chamber debated impeaching Trump, “the majority is asking us to consider a resolution impeaching President Trump and doing so knowing full well even if the House passes this resolution, the Senate will not consider these charges until President Trump’s term ends.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut what Cole didn’t mention is that the Senate is still Republican-controlled, in McConnell’s hands for the next week. And McConnell is said to be privately supportive of impeachment, increasingly open to convicting Trump, and thus, perhaps, more open than we thought to bringing back the Senate for a trial now to do maximum damage to the president.McConnell hasn’t decided how he’ll vote, according to conversations first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by The Washington Post. But they report that he has privately told others that Trump probably committed impeachable offenses.One Senate GOP aide speaking to CNN calculated that if McConnell wanted to convict Trump, he could bring along 16 other Republicans. “If Mitch is a yes, he's done,” that person said of the president.Story continues below advertisementGeorgetown Law constitutional scholar and author Josh Chafetz says there are no strict timelines on how slowly or quickly the Senate has to hold such a trial, or how long it has to wait after the House impeachment to do it.AdvertisementHouse Democrats say they will send the article of impeachment immediately over to the Senate after they vote on it later Wednesday.Deciding whether to convict the president will be a major moment for McConnell — and the president, and the Republican Party.But before we even get there, he has another big decision to make that could also shape Trump’s legacy: whether to call the Senate back in session to hold a trial while Trump is still in office.This has been updated with the latest news.",

        "article": "At a Dec. 5 rally in Valdosta, Ga., President Trump told the crowd: “We’re all victims. Everybody here. All these thousands of people here tonight. They’re all victims. Every one of you.” To many observers, last week’s Capitol riot shows that feelings of victimhood can be a powerful motivator.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightOur research shows that feelings of victimhood can indeed be stoked by politicians, and are linked to support for Trump and his policy agenda. Victimhood is also related to the conspiracy theories and distrust displayed at the Capitol.A violent mob overran Congress. 3 takeaways for the weeks ahead.How many Americans think they’re victims?We argue that there are at least two types of victimhood. “Egocentric” victims believe they’re getting less than they deserve. “Systemic” victims are different in that they identify a culprit and believe “the system” is unfairly stacked against them.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTo measure victimhood, we polled nationally representative samples of 1,020 and 800 U.S. adults in February 2019 and August 2020. We asked respondents how much they agreed or disagreed with the statements below.Egocentric victimhood:I usually have to settle for less. (42 percent agree)I never seem to get an extra break. (36 percent)Great things never come to me. (28 percent)I rarely get what I deserve in life. (27 percent)Systemic victimhood:The system is rigged to benefit a select few. (54 percent agree)The system works against people like me. (36 percent)The world is “doing it” to me and there’s nothing I can do about it. (21 percent)The world is out to get me. (14 percent)Depending on the item, anywhere from 14 to 54 percent of Americans agree with these sentiments. Perceived victimhood is generally not the majority position but it is prevalent among a significant minority.Moreover, the two types of victimhood tend to go together: Those high in egocentric victimhood are typically high in systemic victimhood as well.Who feels like a victim?Believing you’re a victim doesn’t appear to depend on any true state of oppression. In other words, people do not need to actually be victimized to feel like a victim.Story continues below advertisementFor example, a roughly equal fraction of Whites (53 percent) and non-Whites (57 percent) agree that “the system is rigged to benefit a select few.” Perceived victimhood doesn’t depend on gender either. For instance, while 39 percent of women agreed with the statement “I usually have to settle for less,” 45 percent of men did so. We didn’t find large differences based on education either. This helps explain why victimhood could loom so large in the minds of Capitol rioters, even though many appear to have been fairly privileged, based on race and socioeconomic status.AdvertisementPerceived victimhood is also similar among Republicans and Democrats and among conservatives and liberals. For example, 28 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats expressed agreement with the statement “great things never come to me.”Politicians can encourage a sense of victimhoodStory continues below advertisementInstead, any partisan differences may lie more in who is activating and encouraging these feelings, and when. In an experiment conducted in an April 2020 poll of 513 American adults, we investigated how much Trump and then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden could generate feelings of victimhood among their supporters by using rhetoric similar to Trump’s claims in Georgia.Specifically, we told a random subset of respondents that their preferred candidate (Trump or Biden) had said the following:“You, the middle class and working people, have been the victims of so much. You never seem to catch a break, and always seem to pay the steepest price.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt’s sad, it really is. And I’m going to keep fighting for you no matter what.”Compared to a group that did not read a statement, people who saw this statement were 10 points more likely to agree with the four egocentric victimhood statements. For instance, the percentage who agreed with the statement, “I never seem to get an extra break,” increased from 24 percent to 35 percent.Don’t miss any of TMC’s smart analysis! Sign up here for our newsletter.And this was only after reading a single brief statement. Politicians may have a larger effect after they engage in an extended campaign like Trump’s effort to delegitimize the election and convince his supporters that they’re being victimized.The consequences of perceived victimhoodStory continues below advertisementOur study finds that perceived victimhood relates to many characteristics observed at the Capitol — including dissatisfaction with government and support for Trump. This is particularly true among White people.AdvertisementFor instance, egocentric and systemic victimhood are both positively related to distrust of government. Perceived victims are also more likely to explain major events and circumstances using conspiratorial narratives.There are more specific political consequences as well. For example, after accounting for other factors, people who manifest egocentric victimhood are more likely to support Trump and a border wall with Mexico, and more likely to oppose “political correctness.”Story continues below advertisementNotably, these linkages are about twice as large for White respondents as non-White respondents. This means that although racial groups do not differ in how victimized they feel, they differ in how much perceived victimization is activated and linked to political attitudes. And White people who feel victimized are particularly prone to supporting Trump and are, therefore, amenable to Trump’s victim narrative.What you need to know about how many Americans condone political violence — and whyWhat this means for the U.S. Capitol riotAdvertisementBoth forms of victimhood may have been present among the Capitol rioters, including those who feel that their voices were not being heard and that outside forces were conspiring against them — and their president. The riot also had clear evidence of a distinctly White victimhood, visible in the Confederate flags, anti-Semitic regalia and participation of known neo-Nazis and white nationalists.Story continues below advertisementFundamentally, the riot shows that feelings of victimhood have real, even dire, political consequences — especially when those feelings are inflamed by a leader like Trump. While Trump will not be in office after Jan. 20, his supporters will likely continue to feel like victims. And this does not bode well for a peaceful presidential transition or a civil politics in the months or years ahead.Professors: Check out TMC’s expanding list of classroom topic guides. Miles T.

        "article": "President Trump traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday and recited a bunch of old claims about immigrants and crime that we’ve long rated false or misleading.For example, Trump repeated the explosive but unproven claim that terrorists from the Middle East have been apprehended at the southern border.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Trump administration first made this assertion in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections — but it never offered any proof or identified a single terrorist. State Department reports say terrorists have not been found at the southern border in recent years.Here’s a roundup of some of Trump’s false or misleading claims from his remarks in Alamo, Tex., one of his final events in office. Our practice is not to award Pinocchios when we round up multiple claims, but Trump as usual butchered the facts with his spin about immigrants, ending his term as it began. Imagine a bunch of bouncing Pinocchios as you read through his spin.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional and open border. Everybody was pouring in. … We reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history. It is at a level that it’s never been before.”This is mostly wrong. The Trump administration built hundreds of miles of fortified fencing along the border and clamped down on asylum requests and legal migration. But hundreds of thousands of migrants already were being apprehended under the Obama administration in the years before Trump took office.After an initial decline in the yearly totals of unauthorized migrants detained at the southern border, the number of such apprehensions spiked in 2019, so Trump’s claim to having the “most secure southern border in U.S. history” is dubious at best.Story continues below advertisementUnauthorized migration “had been generally declining” from 2000 to 2017, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. But then it jumped.Advertisement“After reaching an all-time peak of 1,643,679 in FY2000, apprehensions fell to a 45-year low of 303,916 in FY2017,” the report notes. “In FY2018 apprehensions increased to 396,579, and in FY2019 they more than doubled to 851,508.”“We’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records, some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder.”It’s unclear where Trump is getting this figure. For fiscal 2020, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported 103,603 administrative arrests, down 28 percent from 2019. That’s far from half a million. ICE added that 90 percent of the administrative arrests involved people with a prior conviction, and the agency said it contributed to 4,360 criminal arrests in 2020.Story continues below advertisementTrump often suggests, as in these remarks, that everyone arrested by ICE has committed a violent crime, “like murder,” but many have only immigration or nonviolent offenses on their records.Advertisement“One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud under the old broken system. If you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country. The most ridiculous thing anyone’s ever seen. And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country. We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud, and that’s what we did.”Wrong on multiple levels. Trump sharply curtailed the U.S. asylum system, lowering caps on yearly admissions. Before his changes, it was not enough merely to request asylum to enter the country, as Trump claimed. Applicants had to undergo an interview with immigration officials and show a “credible fear” of persecution or torture in their home country.Story continues below advertisementTrump’s strict new asylum rules were set to take effect Monday, but they were blocked by a federal judge in San Francisco.Advertisement“Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region. Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a U.S. community. Before my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them. They would say, no, no, no. … They said they won’t take them back. They came. They may be murderers, they may be cartel heads. They may be some really vicious people. The countries didn’t want them back. And I stopped all payments to those countries. I stopped everything going to those countries. And after we stopped for about a month, you remember after we stopped for about a month, they called. They said we’d love to have them back.”Trump often fabricates conversations in which he stuns various heads of state with his knowledge or negotiating skills and they bend to his will.Story continues below advertisementHis claim that El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras “wouldn’t accept” deportees prior to the Trump administration’s regional asylum negotiations, which date to 2018, is flat-out false. The three countries accepted hundreds of thousands of returnees from the United States every year, both before and during Trump’s term, official statistics show.Advertisement“We also have, and we had, but we have them all the time, we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border. That was before what you see right here [gestures at border wall], because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means. … These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East. And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand.”The Trump administration first asserted this in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, offering a range of misleading statistics to buttress the claim that terrorists from the Middle East were filtering through the U.S.-Mexico border. But administration officials never offered any proof or identified a single terrorist.Story continues below advertisementIn reports issued during the Trump administration, the State Department said that there was “no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States” and that “there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region.”(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles",

        "article": "President Trump is using the presidential bully pulpit to hit back at Big Tech. With less than a week left in office, it's basically the only weapon he has left. Trump blasted social media companies in his first public comments since Twitter permanently suspended his account in the wake of the Capitol assault. He told reporters yesterday the industry had done a “horrible thing for our country and to our country.” Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightHe also said the companies had made a “catastrophic mistake” and acted in a politically “divisive” manner when they moved to muzzle his digital megaphone, after determining Trump violated their rules on inciting violence. Trump also defended his speech to his supporters ahead of last week's mob, saying even its controversial parts were “totally acceptable,” my colleague Tony Romm reports. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPolitical operatives from both parties noted there were few official actions that Trump would be able to take to crack down on Silicon Valley. Executive orders are essentially the only tool at the president's disposal that could be enacted in a matter of days. But even if Trump were to again use a presidential action to crack down on the industry, it's unclear whether he has the personnel in place within government agencies to carry it out. And President-elect Joe Biden could always reverse such a move within a matter of days of taking office. “Who's left to write it up, put it in action?” said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist. “The practical starts to be part of the equation.” Trump's dilemma speaks to the extraordinary power Silicon Valley companies hold. Social media companies can effectively can deplatform the most powerful man in the world — and the sitting president can do nothing but complain about it. They have forced his return to traditional media channels rather than sounding off directly to his supporters in 280 characters or less. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump received another blow from the tech industry last night as YouTube announced that it suspended the president from uploading new videos to his account for at least the next seven days. The company said it it removed new content uploaded to the president’s account for violating its policies and “in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence.”That level of influence is contributing to global skepticism of large tech companies. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back on Twitter's decision as “problematic” earlier this week. “The fundamental right [of freedom of expression] can be interfered with, but along the lines of the law and within the framework defined by the lawmakers. Not according to the decision of the management of social media platforms,” government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said.At this point, one of Trump's best options would be to make a public relations push. The president continues to wield an enormous amount of influence over his supporters, as more than 70 million people voted for him in the presidential election. It's possible he could encourage them to boycott the major tech companies that have cracked down on him and his allies. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“He'd be more effective at asking all of his followers and supporters to delete their Twitter account, delete Facebook, not buy Apple products, not use Amazon, etc.,” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist who previously led Mike Bloomberg's mayoral campaign. “If he instituted a boycott, it may not be big enough for companies that size to really feel it but if 74 million people voted for him, some will also join the boycott.”Our top tabsHouse Democrats want more data about home Internet shutoffs. Democratic lawmakers want top telecom companies to share more information about Americans who are falling behind on their Internet bills, Tony reports. That could foreshadow congressional action to expand broadband stimulus aid as part of the next coronavirus relief package.Story continues below advertisementReps. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), Jerry McNerney (Calif.) and Mike Doyle (Pa.) said that AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and other carriers need to be more upfront about their customers’ financial situations and the steps they are taking to ensure people do not lose Internet access, as families across the country are connecting to work and school online. AdvertisementThe lawmakers have seen local reports of constituents being disconnected in recent months, as well as growing concerns that Internet providers might cap or raise prices on home Internet use. The Federal Communications Commission created a voluntary agreement with telecom companies to ensure Americans could stay online even if they couldn't pay their bills early in the pandemic. But the agreement expired over the summer, and it's unclear how effective it was. “We hear reports from the district that people are losing their Internet service, kids are lacking education as a result, businesses are suffering,” McNerney said in an interview with Tony. “The companies made a pledge. We know it expired, but we don’t see [if] that pledge has been honored — we don’t know.”Story continues below advertisementCongressional lawmakers recently approved $7 billion in new federal broadband aid, which it has largely allocated as part of an emergency rebate program that will provide discounts to low-income Americans. But the program may not be ready until February at the earliest, leading Democrats to seek data now from Internet service providers to determine how quickly they need to move to bring more relief. A group of hackers worked to archive Parler posts so incriminating comments would not be lost.A researcher who said she was in the process of archiving nearly all public posts on Parler dealt a parting blow to users who had flocked to the site on the promise of free speech, my colleagues Rachel Lerman and Nitasha Tiku report. The scraping would not have been as easy for a bigger website with more security measures in place. AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe researchers' moves stand in sharp contrast with Parler executives' rhetoric, who said one of the service's key selling points was privacy. “It’s one thing to have the intention of privacy, and it’s another to be able to deliver it in a meaningful way,” security researcher Troy Hunt said Monday. Hunt, who was not involved in the data leak, pointed out that although the data may have been legally obtained, Facebook and Twitter have controls in place to prevent such scraping.Parler was taken offline after Amazon Web Services suspended service, and Apple and Google blocked it from their app stores. But smaller players, such as security firm Okta, also dropped it as a customer. Story continues below advertisementThe Post has not been able to independently verify the archive of scraped Parler posts, but Internet sleuths have said they’ve started using the information.A labor union and ride-hailing drivers are suing to overturn Prop 22. The group alleges that the ballot measure – which cemented Uber and Lyft drivers' status as independent contractors – violates the state constitution, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports. They say Prop 22 could limit the power of sate legislators to enact certain worker protections. AdvertisementThe Service Employees International Union and drivers asked the California Supreme Court to invalidate the measure, which passed in November with the support of 58 percent of voters. The suit also alleges the initiative violated a rule that limits ballot measures to a single subject to prevent confusion among voters. Story continues below advertisementThe Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition, which represents gig companies including Uber, pushed back on the lawsuit through a statement attributed to Uber driver Jim Pyatt. Pyatt has worked in favor of Prop 22. “Nearly 10 million California voters — including the vast majority of app-based drivers — passed Prop 22 to protect driver independence, while providing historic new protections,\" said Pyatt, of Modesto, who is retired and drives for Uber. \"Voters across the political spectrum spoke loud and clear, passing Prop 22 in a landslide.

        "article": "The House voted 232 to 197 on Wednesday to impeach President Trump an unprecedented second time, on a charge of “inciting violence” against the U.S. government. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) left open the possibility of voting to convict at a trial, which would occur after Trump leaves office next week.During debate on the House floor, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Trump “bears responsibility” for last week’s violent takeover of the Capitol but argued against impeachment so close to the end of his term. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Trump “a clear and present danger” and said “he must go.”Here’s what to know:In his first public statement since getting impeached a second time, Trump condemned violence without mentioning his indictment for inciting the attack at the Capitol. “Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,” the president said in a video statement. He warned his supporters that upcoming demonstrations should remain peaceful.President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next week, has announced no public events Wednesday as Trump’s impeachment is debated on the House floor.An additional 5,000 members of the National Guard could arrive to support Inauguration Day security in Washington, city officials said Wednesday, which would increase the total to at least 20,000 in a rapidly swelling security apparatus focused on the Capitol.National Guard plan for inauguration expands to at least 20,000 troops in D.C., acting police chief saysBy Missy Ryan, Alex Horton, Matt Zapotosky and Dan Lamothe2:49 a.m.Link copiedlinkNational Guard forces from a growing list of states moved into positions across Washington on Wednesday as authorities scrambled to understand the extent of threats surrounding President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration and prevent a repeat of last week’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.Security officials conducted tabletop exercises to rehearse inauguration security and strengthen coordination among a massive patchwork of police, National Guard troops and federal personnel that is expected to fan out ahead of protests this weekend and the Jan. 20 transfer of power.By next week, the D.C. police chief said, upward of 20,000 guardsmen were expected to be in place to protect against violence, days after supporters of President Trump smashed their way into the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Biden’s electoral win.Read the full storyarrow-rightAdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementBiden urges Senate to not let Trump impeachment trial impede other workBy Colby Itkowitz1:49 a.m.Link copiedlinkBiden, who has tried to stay out of the debate around impeaching Trump, released a statement on the House vote, but urged lawmakers not to lose sight of the work to be done on the pandemic, the economy and his Cabinet nominations.“Today, the members of the House of Representatives exercised the power granted to them under our Constitution and voted to impeach and hold the president accountable,” Biden said. “It was a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience. The process continues to the Senate.”The president-elect then turned his comments to the coronavirus and the nation’s economic woes, and said he hopes the Senate can hold its impeachment trial “while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.”As Democrats marched toward impeachment since last week’s attack, Biden has been tepid in his support, saying the decision was up to the lawmakers and that he was focused on Jan. 20, when Trump would be gone and he could get to work on the issues devastating America.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementPelosi announces fines for lawmakers who refuse to walk through metal detectors installed after Capitol riotsBy Amy B Wang1:48 a.m.Link copiedlinkHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has announced fines of at least $5,000 for lawmakers who refuse to follow new screening protocols, including walking through metal detectors that were installed at the entrance of the House chamber after last Wednesday’s violent riots.Since then, several Republican lawmakers have refused to comply with the new safety measures, instead stepping around the metal detectors, ignoring police even after setting off the machines and loudly complaining in their refusals to comply with Capitol Police officers.Freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who has vowed to bring her handgun to Congress, on Tuesday ended up in a standoff with police after refusing to hand over her bag after setting off the metal detector.“Sadly, just days later, many House Republicans have disrespected our heroes by verbally abusing them and refusing to adhere to basic precautions keeping members of our Congressional community, including the Capitol Police, safe,” Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday night announcing the rule change.Pelosi said a lawmaker who refused to abide by the new safety protocols would incur a $5,000 fine for the first offense and a $10,000 fine for the second offense. The fines will be deducted directly from lawmakers’ salaries, she noted.“It is tragic that this step is necessary, but the Chamber of the People’s House must and will be safe,” Pelosi said.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementThe Founding Father who was impeached after leaving the Senate in shameBy Gillian Brockell1:10 a.m.Link copiedlinkWith the House having impeached Trump for a second time, outgoing Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the earliest his chamber would start a trial is after Trump has already left office.

With a few exceptions, Biden’s Cabinet picks will require Senate confirmation.Earlier Wednesday, Biden’s transition team urged “swift hearings and confirmations” for its national security nominees in light of reports of potential threats and additional violence across the country.“The team is engaging with the current administration to gain as much information as possible on the threat picture, and on the preparations being put in place to deter and defend against violent disruptions or attacks,” the transition team said in a statement.“The incoming team is also focused on laying the groundwork for a smooth handoff in power that will ensure continuous command and control across the homeland security and law enforcement components of the U.S. government.”A hearing for Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, has been scheduled for Jan. 19, the day before Inauguration Day.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementPelosi signs article of impeachment, speaks from lectern that was taken from chamber during Capitol siegeBy Felicia Sonmez and Paul Kane11:44 p.m.Link copiedlinkThe House Speaker's lectern was returned from the Senate side on Jan. 13. It had been stolen on Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. (The Washington Post)After the House voted Wednesday to impeach Trump for a second time, Pelosi addressed reporters at the Capitol, speaking from behind a lectern that photos last week showed had been carried out of the House chamber by one of the rioters.“It was not damaged,” a Pelosi spokesman said of the lectern, which had been abandoned on the Senate side of the Capitol after the would-be thieves apparently got tired of carrying it.In remarks before she signed the article of impeachment, Pelosi said she was doing so “with a heart broken over what this means to our country, of a president who would incite insurrection.”“Today, in a bipartisan way, the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States, that Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our country and that once again, we honor that oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help us God,” Pelosi said.Adam Johnson, 36, of Bradenton, Fla., is accused of theft of government property in connection with the lectern, in addition to trespassing on Capitol grounds, entering violently and committing disorderly conduct while there.Rachel Weiner contributed to this report.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementTrump: ‘I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week’By Amy B Wang11:30 p.m.Link copiedlinkPresident Trump on Jan. 13 said he \"unequivocally\" condemns the attack on the U.S. Capitol a week prior, adding that \"there must be no violence.\" (The White House)In a video statement released Wednesday, Trump said he “unequivocally” condemned the attack on the U.S. Capitol last week and warned his supporters that upcoming demonstrations should remain peaceful.“Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America great again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation’s most sacred traditions, and mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for,” Trump said in a five-minute video released shortly after the House voted to impeach him.Trump attempted to distance himself from the rioters, even though all evidence has shown they were overwhelmingly supporters of the president, drawn to Washington by his rhetoric and their shared grievance over his baseless claims that the presidential election was “stolen.”“No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans,” Trump said Wednesday. “If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it, and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it.”Appearing to read off a script, Trump said he had heard reports that there would be additional demonstrations, and said that while it was his supporters’ First Amendment right to convene and exercise their free speech, they must remain peaceful. There have been credible reports of additional violent pro-Trump protests planned between now and Inauguration Day, and the FBI warned this week that similar violence could break out at state capitols, as well.“I must emphasize there must be no violence, no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind,” Trump said.In the video, Trump made no mention of the election, and still did not concede that Joe Biden won a free and fair election. The remarks in the video also contradicted his own initial statement the night of the Capitol riot last Wednesday, in which he told his supporters to go home, adding: “We love you. You’re very special.”The video was released through the White House Twitter account; Trump’s main account, @realDonaldTrump, was permanently suspended last week on fears it could incite further violence. Trump alluded to the ban in his latest video, saying there had been an “unprecedented assault on free speech.”AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementIn Senate impeachment trial for Trump, question is whether chief justice or vice president would presideBy Robert Barnes11:10 p.m.Link copiedlinkA Supreme Court spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday about whether Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been in contact with Senate leaders about the impeachment trial of President Trump or whether he should preside if the trial takes place after Trump leaves office.Roberts was in the chair last year when the Senate acquitted Trump, fulfilling the constitutional command that “when the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.” But Trump will not be “the president” when the Senate holds its trial, and at least one expert on impeachment thinks that means that Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, should preside.Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who wrote a book on impeachment and who advised congressional Democrats last year, said he thought it would be up to the Senate majority leader and parliamentarian to decide who should preside at a Senate trial after Trump leaves office.“I think it is a straightforward answer, though: The chief would not preside because Trump would no longer occupy the presidential office,” Gerhardt wrote in an email. “Thus, VP Harris would preside, as is usual when the subject of an impeachment trial is not the president.”Gerhardt noted that the “Constitution empowered the CJ to preside over a presidential impeachment trial because the framers did not trust the VP who would otherwise preside but have an incentive to support a conviction.” In other impeachment matters — for instance, the impeachment of a judge — the vice president presides. But Gerhardt noted these are uncharted waters.As for the chief justice’s schedule, the Supreme Court after oral arguments Tuesday does not have another round of hearings scheduled until Feb. 22. Roberts will be busy on Wednesday — swearing in President-elect Joe Biden.AdvertisementUpdates continue below advertisementMcConnell says there is ‘simply no chance’ that Senate could finish an impeachment trial before Trump is out of officeBy Felicia Sonmez10:49 p.m.Link copiedlinkSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday threw cold water on the idea of holding an impeachment trial during Trump’s last days in office, stating that it would not be possible for the chamber to complete those proceedings before Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.In a statement shortly after the House voted to impeach Trump for a second time, McConnell said the Senate process will begin “at our first regular meeting following receipt of the article from the House.”“Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week,” McConnell said.He added that even if the process were to begin this week, “no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office.”“In light of this reality, I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden Administration,” McConnell said.Earlier Wednesday, McConnell sent a note to his Republican colleagues telling them that he has not made a final decision on how he would vote on Trump’s impeachment. The New York Times reported that McConnell has told people that he sees the impeachment as a way “to purge [Trump] from the party.”McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have not tried to stop the Democrats’ efforts to hold Trump accountable for the Jan. 6 attack, though McCarthy voted against Trump’s impeachment Wednesday. Neither GOP leader has called on Trump to resign.Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that regardless of timing, there will be a Senate trial.“A Senate trial can begin immediately, with agreement from the current Senate Majority Leader to reconvene the Senate for an emergency session, or it will begin after January 19th,” Schumer said in a statement. “But make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again.”Trump’s actions, Schumer added, “cannot and must not be tolerated, excused, or go unpunished.”GOP Sens. Toomey, Sasse leave open possibility of voting to convict TrumpBy Amy B Wang and Seung Min Kim10:34 p.m.Link copiedlinkSens. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) left open the possibility of voting to convict Trump should the Senate hold an impeachment trial, even after the president leaves office.“I stand by my statements over the last week regarding President Trump and the role he played in the deadly riot at the Capitol,” Toomey said in a statement Wednesday after the House impeached Trump.Since the attack on the Capitol, Toomey has said he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses but shied away from pushing impeachment as the best possible option forward, citing the limited number of days remaining in Trump’s term. He has pushed Trump to resign instead, something the president is unlikely to do.“President Trump will be out of office before a Senate impeachment trial can begin. Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office is debatable,” Toomey said in his statement. “Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump’s lawyers.”Sasse said he would be limiting what he said in advance, as a juror, but blasted Trump for pushing lies and conspiracy theories about the election.“By January 6th, the lie had morphed into the nutty theory that Vice President Pence could violate his constitutional oath by formally declaring Trump the victor of an election he lost. When the President urged his supporters to disrupt the proceedings of the January 6th Joint Meeting of Congress by ‘fighting like hell,’ it was widely understood that his crowd included many people who were planning to fight physically, and who were prepared to die in response to his false claims of a ‘stolen election,’“ Sasse said in a statement Wednesday.“Since last Wednesday afternoon, before the Capitol was even cleared of rioters, it’s been obvious that the President was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law. Given the fact that the FBI is investigating widespread calls for violence across the nation in the coming days, every American has an obligation to lower the temperature. Six people, including two police officers, have already died. Lord, have mercy.”10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump. Here’s who they are. By Colby Itkowitz10:12 p.m.Link copiedlinkTen of the 211 House Republicans rebuked Trump Wednesday by voting with Democrats to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.The Republicans who broke from Trump as the president prepares to leave office in a week represent varying factions of the caucus, from Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third ranking in House GOP leadership, to Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), a moderate who has been in office for three decades, to Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.), a conservative who has been loyal to Trump.That the 10 Republicans who voted to charge Trump with “incitement of insurrection” could not so easily be lumped together suggests a fracturing of support for the president among Republicans after four years of his stranglehold over the party.The other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump are: Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), John Katko (N.Y.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Peter Meijer (Mich.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.), David Valadao (Calif.).Biden receives briefing from senior FBI, Secret Service officials on security landscape amid threats ahead of inaugurationBy Felicia Sonmez9:31 p.m.Link copiedlinkBiden was briefed Wednesday by senior officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and members of his national security team on the security outlook ahead of next week’s inauguration, the Biden transition team said in a statement.The briefing comes amid threats of “armed protests” in multiple cities, including the District of Columbia, and as officials scramble to avoid a potential repeat of last week’s attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.“Today, President-elect Biden received a briefing from senior officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, and key members of his national security team,” the Biden transition said. “The team is engaging with the current administration to gain as much information as possible on the threat picture, and on the preparations being put in place to deter and defend against violent disruptions or attacks.”The transition team also said it is “focused on laying the groundwork for a smooth handoff in power that will ensure continuous command and control across the homeland security and law enforcement components of the U.S. government.”The FBI warned Monday that armed far-right extremist groups are planning to march on state capitals this weekend, triggering a rush to fortify government buildings. In Washington, D.C., the Secret Service on Wednesday took command of security preparations at the Capitol and other federal buildings, backed by as many as 15,000 National Guard troops, thousands of police and tactical officers, and layers of eight-foot steel fencing.In Wednesday’s statement, the Biden team praised the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s decision to schedule a Jan. 19 hearing on the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas as Biden’s Homeland Security secretary and said it is “critical” that Biden’s national security nominees “receive swift hearings and confirmations.”Biden’s team receives daily security and operational briefings to ensure a smooth presidential transition, according to the statement.Carol D. Leonnig and Missy Ryan contributed to this report.In bipartisan rebuke, House members vote to impeach Trump an unprecedented second time, on charge of ‘inciting violence’By Donna Cassata and Felicia Sonmez9:29 p.m.Link copiedlinkThe House on Wednesday voted to impeach Trump on a charge of “inciting violence” against the U.S. government, making him the first president in U.S. history to have been impeached twice.The final vote count was 232 in favor and 197 opposed. Ten Republicans joined all Democrats present in voting to impeach Trump.The vote came seven days before Trump leaves office and one week after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, resulting in five deaths and endangering the lives of the vice president and members of Congress.Trump now faces a Senate trial after his term ends, when the chamber could vote on barring him from future elective office if he is convicted.The 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump are Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), John Katko (N.Y.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Peter Meijer (Mich.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.), Tom Rice (S.C.), Fred Upton (Mich.) and David Valadao (Calif.).Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s husband, who was in lockdown room with her, tests positive for the coronavirusBy Colby Itkowitz9:11 p.m.Link copiedlinkRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and her husband left the location they were in for a secure room where members and some staffers were waiting out the siege on the Capitol last week, she said.But when they got there, the room was overcrowded, and a group of maskless GOP lawmakers were huddled together in one part of the room.Before long, Pressley said she decided it wasn’t worth trading one threat for another, and she and her husband chose to return to the location that wouldn’t provide them the same protection from violence but wasn’t a coronavirus risk.And yet, Pressley revealed Thursday, her husband, Conan Harris, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Pressley herself has tested negative, she said in a statement.Calling her GOP colleagues “callous,” Pressley said their “arrogant disregard for the lives of others is infuriating, but not surprising and we are seeing the consequences of it daily, as several of my colleagues — and now my husband — test positive for covid-19.”Harris is the fourth known person who spent time in the lockdown room to have contracted the virus.In the secure room last week, Pressley checked on friends but grew increasingly uncomfortable with the growing congregation of maskless GOP colleagues.“This is crazy,” Pressley thought, according to a senior Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe what transpired in the room. “We’re not going to survive a terrorist attack to be exposed to a deadly virus.” It felt too risky to stay, so the congresswoman left the police-protected space for a less secure room where she wouldn’t be potentially exposed to the coronavirus.Apart from Pressley’s husband, three Democratic lawmakers in that room, including a 75-year-old cancer survivor, have tested positive for the coronavirus, and Democrats are enraged at the Republicans who they say got their colleagues sick.“The second I realized our ‘safe room’ from the violent white supremacist mob included treasonous, white supremacist, anti masker Members of Congress who incited the mob in the first place, I exited,” Pressley tweeted Tuesday. “Furious that more of my colleagues by the day are testing positive.”Throughout the day, House Democrats expressed unbridled outrage about the maskless lawmakers, adding to the already raw anger they have toward many of those same Republicans who they see as contributing to the incitement of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.",

        "article": "Republicans who have lined up to support President Trump following the violence that occurred last week at the U.S. Capitol in Washington have often sought to distance him from the actions of his supporters by pointing to the speech he gave outside the White House that morning.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right“I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,” Trump said that morning. How could anyone hold him responsible for what ensued?Trump himself has appealed to this argument, insisting Tuesday that nothing about his Jan. 6 speech suggested incitement. It was, like his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019, beyond reproach.Story continues below advertisement“It’s been analyzed,” he said of the speech, “and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate.”AdvertisementLike that call with Zelensky, which led to Trump’s impeachment in December 2019, though, the issue is far broader than one speech or one conversation. The groundwork for what occurred at the Capitol was established well before that day. In fact, it stretches back months, to at least April, when Trump began raising questions about the reliability of the 2020 presidential vote.Trump’s supporters raided the Capitol because he insisted that the election was stolen and that something had to be done. This is the timeline of why they came to accept that and how Trump fostered that belief. (Parts of this timeline come from Just Security’s overview of the president’s actions.)Story continues below advertisementBefore 2020: Since he declared his candidacy, Trump has been reticent to overtly criticize those who support him, regardless of their politics. That includes self-proclaimed white-nationalist groups, whom Trump has criticized only when pressed and then only with qualifiers. In March 2019, the Pew Research Center found that most Americans believed Trump had done too little to distance himself from self-described white nationalists. Self-proclaimed white-nationalist groups expanded during his presidency.AdvertisementApril: With the emergence of the novel coronavirus and infections surging nationally, states began rethinking how they would deal with voting in the presidential primaries and in November’s general election. After the state of Wisconsin postponed its primary elections, Trump lashed out at the state and the shift to mail-in voting.“Now, mail ballots — they cheat,” Trump said April 7. “Okay? People cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they’re cheaters. They go and collect them. They’re fraudulent in many cases.”Story continues below advertisementOver the next few months, the number of Republicans indicating that they would vote by mail declined.May: On April 30, protesters stormed the state Capitol in Michigan to protest measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.Protesters rallied against Michigan's stay-at-home order on April 30 as lawmakers considered whether to extend the state’s expiring declaration. (@QuirkyFollowsQ via Storyful)The next day, Trump sided with the protesters on Twitter.Advertisement“The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” he wrote. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.”He had previously offered the same sentiment on social media, calling obliquely for unnamed people to “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and other states, using revolutionary language to describe opposition to stay-at-home orders and business closures. Trump’s frustrations with those orders stemmed at least in part from his concern that the closures would hurt the economy in the months before he sought reelection.Story continues below advertisementJune: As the months passed, Trump continued to elevate various fraud claims, generally ones detached from any actual demonstrated wrongdoing. He claimed, for example, that mail-in balloting would make the vote susceptible to a flood of votes sent from foreign actors, a claim that was obviously nonsensical even at the time.AdvertisementIn late May and into June, the country was wracked by another point of tension: protests centered on the death of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement. Some of those protests devolved into violence and vandalism, which Trump used to amplify campaign rhetoric about the need to protect the public. Over the ensuing months, Trump continued to link the political left and Democrats to physical violence and opposition to the U.S. government.Trump and the Justice Department repeatedly elevated the threat posed by antifa, a loose-knit ideology whose adherents were at some protests. Demonstrated violence by right-wing actors such as the Proud Boys or members of the “boogaloo” movement, which advocates a second Civil War, was comparatively downplayed.Story continues below advertisementJuly: During an interview with Fox News that aired July 19, Trump declined to say that he would necessarily accept the results of the election.Advertisement“I’m not going to just say yes,” Trump replied. “I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.”At the same time, he continued to make unfounded allegations about fraud.“Mail-In Ballot fraud found in many elections,” Trump tweeted July 10. “People are just now seeing how bad, dishonest and slow it is. Election results could be delayed for months. No more big election night answers? 1% not even counted in 2016. Ridiculous! Just a formula for RIGGING an Election.”Needless to say, this was not an accurate presentation of mail-in balloting.Story continues below advertisementAugust: After Marjorie Taylor Greene won the Republican nomination for Georgia’s 14th District, Trump offered her his explicit praise, despite Greene’s background, which included expressed support for the sprawling QAnon conspiracy theory. The theory holds, among other things, that Trump is fighting a secret war against satanic pedophiles who have infiltrated Democratic politics and Hollywood. In 2019, federal law enforcement identified QAnon as one facet of a rising violent threat posted by conspiracy-theory adherents.AdvertisementOn Aug. 19, Trump was asked about QAnon directly. His response was similar to his past approach to self-described white nationalists.“Well, I don’t know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,” Trump said. “But I don’t know much about the movement.”Story continues below advertisementBy the end of August, it was already clear that Trump’s efforts to mislead his base about the November election posed a significant risk of fomenting violence.Violence had already occurred, without Trump’s condemnation. He refused to condemn Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenage Trump supporter accused of fatally shooting two people at a Black Lives Matter protest in Wisconsin.“I guess it looks like he fell and then they very violently attacked him, and it was something we’re looking at right now and it’s under investigation,” Trump said. “I guess he was in very big trouble. He probably would have been killed. But it’s under investigation.”AdvertisementSeptember: A whistleblower from within the Department of Homeland Security alleged that agency leaders sought to downplay the risk posed by self-described white nationalists and to emphasize the threat of left-wing actors. Trump continued his efforts to cast mail balloting as rife with fraud.Story continues below advertisementIn late September, the president was asked if he would cede power peacefully.“Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very trans — we’ll have a very peaceful — ” Trump replied, “There won’t be a transfer, frankly,” he continued. “There’ll be a continuation.”The “ballots” that Trump wanted to get rid of were the mail ballots against which he had been railing.The next day, both he and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were given a chance to reinforce that Trump would ensure a peaceful transition. Neither did.Advertisement“The president will accept the results of a free and fair election,” McEnany stated — making a peaceful transition contingent on Trump accepting the election as fair. A few hours later, the president made clear that he didn’t plan to do so.“We want to make sure the election is honest, and I’m not sure that it can be,” he said.During his first debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Trump was asked to condemn the presence of self-described white-nationalist and fascistic groups that had shown up at some protests. He was asked explicitly to condemn the Proud Boys.“Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,” Trump replied. “But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem.”The Proud Boys quickly adopted the non-condemnation as an informal slogan.October through Nov. 3: Trump and his allies in conservative media ramp up their allegations that the election results are at risk from fraudulent mail-in voting. The National Republican Campaign Committee, for example, ran ads on Facebook shortly before the election claiming that “Nancy Pelosi and radical Democrats are trying to steal this election.”During a town hall interview with NBC News, Trump again defended QAnon.“I know nothing about it,” he said. “I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard, but I know nothing about it.”This is whitewashing, at best: QAnon adherents accuse a wide array of political actors of being pedophiles, meaning that their “fight” against pedophilia is really an effort to impugn and attack people based on politics.“I’ll tell you what I do know about,” Trump added: “I know about antifa, and I know about the radical left. And I know how violent they are and how vicious they are.”When a group of Trump supporters surrounded Biden’s campaign bus, nearly forcing it off the road, Trump praised them.Election Day: When polls closed on the evening of Nov. 3, Trump held leads in a number of swing states, a predicted artifact of Republicans being more likely to vote on Election Day itself. Democratic voters were more likely to cast mail ballots, meaning that it took longer for those votes to be counted.Early in the morning of Nov. 4, Trump claimed that he had won the election, basing his claim on those incomplete returns. He claimed that fraud was rampant and that he would take his case to the Supreme Court.November and December: Trump elevated a wide array of theories about fraud, none of which were substantiated.He suffered a number of legal and political defeats. Courts rejected his claims about fraud tainting the results. Vote tallies proved that Biden had won the presidency, and Trump’s efforts to block the certification of those votes failed. His effort to interfere with the casting of electoral votes in mid-December was similarly futile.But day after day, Trump continued to allege that the election was stolen from him. He continued to try to persuade state officials to overturn the obvious preferences of their voters.“If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before,” Trump tweeted in December, “the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the Republicans do NOTHING, just want to let it pass. NO FIGHT!”On Dec. 19, Trump tweeted his support for protests in Washington on Jan. 6.“Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,” Trump wrote. “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”Jan. 6, around noon: Trump begins speaking to the crowd gathered outside the White House. In attendance or nearby are thousands of Trump supporters — and scores of QAnon supporters and members of the Proud Boys and self-described white-nationalist groups.“They want to steal the election,” Trump told the crowd to cheers. “The radical left knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re ruthless, and it’s time that somebody did something about it.”His comments about a peaceful protest came early in the speech. Near the end, he was less gentle.“Nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were,” Trump said. “… I said something’s wrong here, something is really wrong.”“And we fight. We fight like hell,” he added. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”He then told the audience that “we” would walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to “try and give [Republicans] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”Within two hours, the mob had broken into the Capitol. Trump, who did not walk with them to their destination, watched the events unfold on a television in the White House. For hours, he ignored entreaties from his embattled allies in the Capitol and declined to act to ensure that the building was secured.While Vice President Pence was being protected in a secure area in the building, Trump tweeted additional encouragement to his supporters in the streets.“Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,” Trump wrote. “USA demands the truth!”“It took him a while to appreciate the gravity of the situation,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in an interview. “The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.”“My people are peaceful,” Trump reportedly said at another point. “My people aren’t thugs.”All of this was predictable. It derived from Trump’s insistences that he couldn’t have lost fairly and his refusal to condemn the right-wing and racist fringe. He spent months building up a sense that the election would be suspect and then spent months claiming that it was. He told his supporters that they would need to fight to overturn the election results.Put succinctly, the president declined to say he would ensure a peaceful transition of power. Then he didn’t.",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn a bitterly divided nation groping toward Biden’s presidency eight days away, each man was speaking a language his supporters understand.Biden’s team announced at 9:03 a.m. that he would make no appearances for the day. That was about an hour before Trump launched what might be his last trip as president with a blast of puffery and prevarication.“We’re going to the southern border. As you know, we’ve completed the wall,” Trump said falsely on the White House lawn, his helicopter whirring behind him. “They may want to expand it. We have the expansion underway. It’s been tremendously successful, far beyond what anyone thought.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBiden had answered a few questions from reporters Monday, after he got his second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.He reiterated his hands-off stance to the Democratic-led efforts to force Trump from office in the wake of the mob attack last Wednesday, and he said he is confident he can safely take the oath of office outdoors on Jan. 20. The handover of power will take place at the Capitol, site of the attempted armed insurrection against his election victory.He is not scheduled to appear in public again until Thursday and Friday, with events focused on his twin plans for the economic and public health responses to the coronavirus pandemic.Republicans begin to join impeachment pushThe incoming president owes his victory in large part to a pledge to return the country to predictable norms and to apply science and effort to the fight the coronavirus, now raging at a record pace even as Americans begin to get lifesaving vaccines.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“My number-one priority is getting vaccines in people’s arms as rapidly as we can,” Biden said Monday, adding that the current death rate, averaging more than 3,000 Americans per day, is “beyond the pale.”“It’s just wrong, and we can do a lot to change it,” Biden said, focusing on a subject Trump has all but ignored since Election Day.Biden seems determined to be the not-Trump, even at the risk of being a bystander to the waning days of the Trump Show. It was the same practice he followed during the campaign, to evident success.By remaining silent Tuesday, Biden was staying on message, said Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Austin.Story continues below advertisement“He ran on being the adult,” she said. “And what do adults do? They roll up their sleeves and get it done.”Some Democrats might prefer to see Biden battling Trump point by point, but Biden is hewing to his instinct that more people want to move on, DeFrancesco Soto said.Advertisement“If I were Biden, I would save my energy” for legislation on immigration and other issues he has pledged to address in the first 100 days of his term, “as opposed to retorting whatever Trump is saying,” she said.“That’s a death spiral,” she said. “If you have to respond to every false claim Trump says, you would use up every minute of the day.”It was perhaps fitting that Trump’s first foray outside the White House since the mob attack would be a visit to the multibillion-dollar border wall project wrought by the “Build that wall” chants he rode to office in 2016.Story continues below advertisementThe wall will now probably never be finished. Biden has vowed not to build another foot of it, and he is under pressure to formally kill off the project with an executive order on his first day in office.It was also fitting that in some of his first in-person public remarks since he launched violent supporters toward the Capitol with the false assertion that the election had been stolen, Trump tried to deflect blame for the result.Advertisement“People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” Trump said as he was about to board Air Force One. He then pivoted to social justice protests last summer and some of vandalism and violence that took place then.Story continues below advertisement“And if you look at what other people have said, politicians at a high level, about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle, in various other places,” Trump said. “That was a real problem.”Besides his assertion about the wall’s completion, Trump also falsely claimed there is a “surge” of illegal immigration, including caravans bent on breaching the border, a claim he also made in 2018. About 450 miles of barrier have been built or rebuilt across a 2,000-mile expanse, the vast majority being a reinforced version of fencing that existed before Trump took office.Part of the job of president is performative, something Trump always understood on a gut level even when he performed badly. He played the same part Tuesday that he often played as president — part emcee, part folk hero, part victim.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementVisiting a section of flag-draped wall near Alamo, Tex., Trump signed his name on a plaque and posed for pictures with Border Patrol agents. Songs from the Trump campaign-rally playlist played as he celebrated, including “YMCA” by the Village People, often the closing number at Trump’s signature political events.“We worked long and hard to get this done,” Trump said of the wall. “They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done.”His speech veered between “Make America Great Again” greatest hits and attempts to address the Capitol assault and the possibility that he may be punished for it in Congress, with asides on the pandemic and the actions taken by major technology companies such as Twitter to mute him.Story continues below advertisement“Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm,” Trump said. “Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement — so many are here — is the foundation of the MAGA agenda,” he said. “We’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order.”AdvertisementBiden aides said Trump’s claims Tuesday are not going unanswered. Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris said during a Univision interview Tuesday evening that immigration will be “our first order of business.”Asked about Trump’s assertions that his words before the Capitol attack were “totally appropriate,” Harris scoffed.“That’s just not true,” Harris said. “It’s simply not true.”Biden kept mum.\nChelsea Janes in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Rep. Liz Cheney’s historic decision Tuesday to vote to impeach President Trump had its roots in a dramatic phone call from her father, former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who was watching events unfold on television last week and warned that she was being verbally attacked by the president.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightCheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking member of the House Republican leadership, became the most prominent congressional Republican to call for Trump’s impeachment. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” Cheney said in a statement. “I will vote to impeach the president.”Six days earlier, Cheney was in the House chamber, urging that Republicans reject efforts pushed by Trump and many others in her party to challenge the electoral college results that determined Trump had lost his reelection bid. She did not know she was being attacked by Trump, who was delivering the speech that would incite a mob to storm the Capitol, until her father reached her by phone in the House cloakroom.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementConstitutional law professor Jared Carter of Vermont Law School outlines the lasting legal ramifications of impeaching President Trump for a second time. (The Washington Post)“We got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world,” Trump said in the speech, singling her out as he urged the mob to march to the Capitol.After being informed of the president’s tirade by her father, Cheney walked out on the House floor, still hoping to stop the effort backed by Trump to overturn the electoral college votes. Then she heard a mob banging on the chamber’s doors and a shot fired, and realized that an attempted insurrection was underway. She hustled to a secure location and later called Fox News.“There is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob,” Cheney told the network where she once worked and whose pundits had long supported Trump. “He lit the flame.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPresident Trump addressed supporters near the White House on Jan. 6, shortly before members of the group stormed the U.S. Capitol. (The Washington Post)The dramatic moments, recounted by a source familiar with them, led her to back impeachment.“The president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence,” Cheney said in the statement. “He did not.”The decision marked an extraordinary denouement for Cheney and her potentially precarious perch in the party’s leadership. She had feuded for months with Trump and lately had been at odds with the majority of her caucus, even as speculation mounts about whether she might one day seek the speakership. The move was applauded by those in the party who have urged a clean break with Trump.“It is a remarkable statement that sets a new bar for leadership in the House,” said Brendan Buck, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner. “She is turning the page on Donald Trump. I think she is doing the right thing in her mind, and when you do the right thing for the right reasons you have to hope the politics work out for you.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAt the same time, he said, the decision will prompt Republicans who disagree with her decision to consider  “whether there should be political consequences for her internally.”Tuesday night, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) called for Cheney to step down as the chair of the House Republican Conference. “She is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead,” he said in a statement. Liz Cheney, 54, has been a member of the House of Representatives for only four years, coinciding with Trump’s presidency. But she rose in meteoric fashion to the top ranks of GOP leadership after just one term representing Wyoming, leaving admirers and enemies in her wake.Story continues below advertisementLiz Cheney declined to comment. Richard Cheney did not respond to a request for comment.She and her father have had an up-and-down relationship with Trump that turned toxic. As she heard Trump and many of her colleagues declare several weeks ago that Congress should seek to challenge the electoral college results, she sat down to write a 21-page memo warning Republicans against the effort.Advertisement“By objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts,” she wrote in the memo, which she released last week. “Such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states’ explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution’s clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans.”Story continues below advertisementCheney’s memo was hailed by Democrats. But the advice was not heeded by the vast majority of those in Cheney’s caucus, as 139 out of 211 House Republicans voted to challenge electoral college votes from Arizona, Pennsylvania or both.Among those supporting the effort to challenge the results was Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), a potential rival to Cheney for the speakership if Republicans regain the House in two years. McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks said Republicans welcome differing views and said the “leadership team is united.”AdvertisementOn Monday night, in a conference call with Republicans, McCarthy said he opposed impeachment, while Cheney declined to reveal her view, other than to say, “This is going to be a vote of conscience.”\nAttacking Democrats\nCheney served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs during the administration of her father’s first term as vice president. She then played a crucial role in the 2004 Bush-Cheney reelection campaign, after which she returned to her post at the State Department and later served a stint as a Fox News pundit.Story continues below advertisementIn 2016, Cheney sought Wyoming’s lone U.S. House seat, which her father had once held.  After winning the seat, Cheney’s ambition was to become one of the most powerful women on Capitol Hill.After winning reelection in 2018, a year in which Republicans lost control of the House, enabling Nancy Pelosi to become speaker, Cheney ran for a post traditionally sought by longtime members: leadership of the House Republican Conference Committee.  AdvertisementShe won the post by arguing that Republicans needed to change their messaging and be more aggressive. Soon she was launching all-out assaults, saying in March 2019 on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that  Democrats were “the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism.”Story continues below advertisementModerator Chuck Todd responded by asking Cheney, “Do you feel comfortable that President Trump has done enough to tamp down this right-wing fringe anti-Semitism that has been rising up?”Cheney did not directly answer the question, which foreshadowed elements of the attack on the Capitol. “Look, I don’t believe this is right or left,” she said. “I think this is an issue on which all of us should come together.”Trump had feuded with Cheney’s father, saying in 2011 that “I didn’t like Cheney when he was a vice president. Here’s a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him.”AdvertisementRichard Cheney, meanwhile, said in February 2016 that Trump sounded like a “liberal Democrat” and that he would not endorse him. But two months later, CNN reported that Cheney was breaking with the two former Bush presidents, who did not support Trump, and endorsed him at a time when the candidate had all but wrapped up the nomination.Story continues below advertisementAfter the election, with Liz Cheney winning a House seat at the same time Trump captured the presidency, Trump baldly tried to win the Cheney family’s goodwill. He pardoned the elder Cheney’s former chief of staff, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump said Liz Cheney had pushed for the pardon.Speaking at the White House in July 2019, Trump said, “Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and Liz was right in the forefront of that one and I said, ‘What do you think, Liz,’ and you said, ‘Absolutely, he deserves it,’ and it’s been a very popular pardon.” At another event, Trump said that “Liz Cheney was so dedicated — and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it.” He called Cheney “a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don’t know, a pretty unlimited future.”AdvertisementSoon, however, Cheney and Trump were at political war.\nA fight with Trump\nCheney criticized Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, seeming to scorn the president’s resistance to wearing a mask by tweeting a picture of her father wearing a face covering with the hashtag #realmenwearmasks. After Trump said “I appreciate” support from QAnon, the conspiracy theory group, Cheney called it a “dangerous lunacy.”Cheney blasted Trump’s proposal to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany as “dangerously misguided,” prompting a rebuke from Trump, who tweeted that “Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars.” The dispute prompted some House Republicans to launch a failed effort to oust her from her leadership post.In his speech inciting the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump sounded obsessed with Cheney’s criticism of him on the issue. After saying “we got to get rid” of Cheney, he said, “You know, she never wants a soldier brought home. I brought a lot of soldiers home.”Cheney, who was unanimously reelected to her leadership position in November, has a voting record that underscores her conservatism. She has high ratings from right-leaning organizations and zero percent ratings from groups such as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for gay rights; the League of Conservation Voters; and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, according to GovTrack.  Stuart Stevens, a political consultant who worked with Liz Cheney during both Bush-Cheney campaigns and recently wrote a book in which he predicted she would run for president, said she has become the “de facto leader of the Republican Party,” which he said should be distinguished from what he called the pro-Trump “authoritarian party.”Cheney’s recent actions helped mend a family rift. She was once criticized by her sister, Mary, who is openly gay and married, for opposing same-sex marriage.“As many people know, Liz and I have definitely had our differences, but I am incredibly proud of how she handled herself during the fight over the Electoral College,” Mary Cheney wrote on her Facebook page last week. “She stood up to President Trump. . . . He even denounced her by name from the stage at yesterday’s rally — something that should definitely be considered a badge of honor. Good job Big Sister.”\nAlice Crites  and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe administration sought to reinstate rules by the Food and Drug Administration that women pick up the abortion pills at a medical facility — rather than receive them by mail or delivery — even though there is no requirement they take the medication in such a setting. Most take the pills that end a pregnancy in its early stages at home.The court’s three liberals objected to reimposing the requirements, which a lower court had eased during the pandemic in an effort to protect women and health workers.Story continues below advertisement“This country’s laws have long singled out abortions for more onerous treatment than other medical procedures that carry similar or greater risks,” wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. She seemed to hold out hope the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden will change the policy.Advertisement“One can only hope that the government will reconsider and exhibit greater care and empathy for women seeking some measure of control over their health and reproductive lives in these unsettling times.”Justice Stephen G. Breyer also noted his dissent, but did not join Sotomayor’s opinion.Abortion pill restrictions remain blocked during pandemic, judge rulesThe court’s conservative majority did not explain its reasoning, as is common in emergency applications. But it has been strengthened by the addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court since it last considered the issue and refused to reinstate the requirements.Story continues below advertisementChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote separately to say he went along with the decision to dissolve the lower court’s stay out of respect for government experts.“My view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the ‘background, competence, and expertise to assess public health,’ ” Roberts wrote, referring to an opinion he wrote upholding state limits on attendance at church worship services.Advertisement“In light of those considerations, I do not see a sufficient basis here for the district court to compel the FDA to alter the regimen for medical abortion.”Supreme Court puts on hold Trump administration request to reimpose medication abortion restrictionsA federal judge this summer had found the rules to be cumbersome and dangerous during the pandemic.Story continues below advertisementThe Supreme Court in the fall told U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in Maryland to reconsider in light of current conditions. But he said last month that the health risks have “only gotten worse.”He stood behind the nationwide injunction he put in place.“While the progress on vaccines and medical treatments for COVID-19 are cause for optimism and may advance the day that the Preliminary Injunction will no longer be warranted, the impact of these advances to date has not meaningfully altered the current health risks and obstacles to women seeking medication abortions,” he wrote.AdvertisementDoctors and abortion providers who brought the suit said the government had not shown there was a good reason to retain the rules, as other more dangerous drugs were dispensed without an in-person visit.Story continues below advertisementThe government asks for “the extraordinary step of staying a preliminary injunction that protects patients and health-care providers from life-threatening COVID-19 risks” they told the court.“It is mind-boggling that the Trump administration’s top priority on its way out the door is to needlessly endanger even more people during this dark pandemic winter — and chilling that the Supreme Court allowed it,” Julia Kaye, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement Tuesday. Biden’s administration, she added, “must right this wrong on day one and hold firm to its commitment to support both evidence-based regulations and reproductive freedom.”AdvertisementMedication abortions require taking two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy. They have been in use since 2000, and in 2016 the FDA eliminated the requirement that the first drug be administered in a hospital, clinic or doctor’s office. FDA experts said it was just as safe for a woman to take the medications at home.Story continues below advertisementBut the FDA did not relax the requirement that women pick up the pills in person and sign for them.Sotomayor said the longtime restriction made no sense.“Of the over 20,000 FDA-approved drugs, mifepristone is the only one that the FDA requires to be picked up in person for patients to take at home,” Sotomayor wrote.She said that government agencies during the pandemic have eased restrictions on picking up other drugs in person.“As a result, government policy now permits patients to receive prescriptions for powerful opioids without leaving home, yet still requires women to travel to a doctor’s office to pick up mifepristone, only to turn around, go home, and ingest it without supervision,” Sotomayor wrote.She called the policy an “unnecessary, unjustifiable, irrational, and undue burden on women seeking an abortion during the pandemic.”The case is FDA v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n",

        "article": "The House made history Wednesday by impeaching a president for a second time, indicting President Trump a week before he leaves office for inciting a riot with false claims of a stolen election that led to the storming of the Capitol and five deaths.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightUnlike Trump’s first impeachment, which proceeded with almost no GOP support, Wednesday’s effort attracted 10 Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 party leader in the House. The Senate now appears likely to hold a trial after Trump’s departure, an unprecedented scenario that could end with lawmakers barring him from holding the presidency again.The final vote was 232 to 197.Read: Article of impeachment against President TrumpOne of the final dramas of a tumultuous presidency, the impeachment unfolded against the backdrop of near-chaos in the House and uncertainty about where Trump’s exit leaves the GOP. Democrats and Republicans exchanged accusations and name-calling throughout the day, while Trump loyalists were livid at fellow Republicans who broke ranks — especially Cheney — leaving the party’s leadership shaken.The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach President Trump a second time after the deadly U.S. Capitol breach. (The Washington Post)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut despite the emotions stirred by the Capitol assault, the great majority of Republicans stood by the president, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). He argued on the House floor that while Trump bears responsibility for the attack on the Capitol, the snap impeachment would only “further fan the flames of partisan division.”McCarthy for the first time publicly endorsed a censure for Trump, but the call came too late to serve as an effective alternative to impeachment.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats made it clear Wednesday that censure would not suffice given the circumstances, with Trump riling up his supporters with false claims of election fraud, then urging them to march on Congress as it was certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.Washington GOP Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse called for President Trump’s impeachment on Jan. 13, one week after a mob stormed the Capitol. (The Washington Post)Story continues below advertisement“He must go,” Pelosi said. “He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”AdvertisementThe House took its final vote Wednesday afternoon, one week after the riot and just two days after the impeachment resolution was filed. It was a stunningly swift response from a House that took nearly three months to impeach Trump in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and contempt of Congress.But with just seven days remaining in Trump’s term, it became increasingly certain Wednesday that Trump would not be removed from office prematurely. The impeachment resolution for “incitement of insurrection,” however, also seeks Trump’s future “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.”Story continues below advertisementThe focus will now turn to how the trial will unfold in the Senate, which has never before held an impeachment trial for a former president.Biden issued a statement shortly after the House vote signaling his concern that his agenda not be sidelined. “I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,” Biden said.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused a request from Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to reconvene the Senate early to launch Trump’s trial. That means it can start the proceedings no sooner than Jan. 19 — a day before Biden’s inauguration.Story continues below advertisementMcConnell, who signaled through advisers Tuesday that he would be open to a possible conviction, said in a memo released as the House debated that there was no chance that a trial could be fairly concluded before the inauguration, even if he agreed to Schumer’s request. Previous presidential impeachment trials, he noted, took 83, 37 and 21 days.McConnell pointedly left open the possibility that he might vote to convict Trump.“I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” he said in the note, first sent to his fellow Republican senators.AdvertisementSchumer, for his part, suggested determination to hold the trial even with Trump gone from the White House. “Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again,” he said.Story continues below advertisementMcCarthy called on the House floor for Trump to “quell the brewing unrest,” and with Republican votes in the balance, Trump quickly issued a brief written statement: “I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” he said. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.”Later Wednesday evening, Trump issued a five-minute video denouncing the protesters: “Mob violence goes against everything I believe in, and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence.”AdvertisementBut the statements came too late for the clutch of Republicans who voted to impeach. Instead, several cited his impromptu remarks the previous day claiming his actions had been “totally appropriate.”Story continues below advertisementThe Republicans who broke from Trump included senior leaders such as Cheney, the GOP conference chairwoman; Rep. John Katko (N.Y.), the top GOP member of the Homeland Security Committee; and Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), a former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. But junior members such as freshman Rep. Peter Meijer (Mich.) and second-term Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio) also voted for impeachment.Some, such as Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), have been sharply critical of Trump in the past. Others, such as Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.), have hardly ever said a cross word about him.“I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice,” Rice said in a statement. “But, this utter failure is inexcusable.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOther Republicans voting to impeach Trump were Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.) and David G. Valadao (Calif.).Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, said the fact that only nine Republicans joined Cheney, and the dam did not break in a more dramatic way, showed that Trump retained wide support within the GOP.Asked if Trump could still be an effective leader of the party, Jordan said, “Of course he is. Of course he is. His support is strong because the American people appreciated that over the past four years he did more of what he said he would do than any president in my lifetime.”Several other Republicans declined to comment on Trump’s future, saying instead that the lopsided GOP vote reflected concerns about the impeachment process and the political environment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It actually represents a feeling among Republicans — even Republicans who are disappointed with this president — that with only seven days left to go in his term and with the toxic political environment being what it is, that there’s a real need in the country to lower the temperature,” said Rep. Garland “Andy” Barr (R-Ky.). “This is viewed by a lot of Americans as an act of political vengeance.”Many GOP members said they were struggling to reconcile their anger at last week’s events, and Trump’s culpability in them, with their fears of escalating violence and threats directed at lawmakers.“This isn’t a fun time, that’s for sure,” said Valadao, who said he was undecided just hours before voting to impeach.Democrats encouraged the handful of Republicans who came to the floor Wednesday in support of impeachment. When Newhouse broke publicly with Trump on the House floor, colleagues across the aisle delivered applause.Advertisement“These articles of impeachment are flawed, but I will not use process as an excuse,” he said. “There is no excuse for President Trump’s actions.”But most Republicans speaking Wednesday put little distance between themselves and Trump. Many sidestepped the actual charge against Trump, instead arguing that the Democrats were being divisive and that impeachment was unnecessary so close to Trump’s departure.Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), leader of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who had embraced the “Stop the Steal” effort that culminated in the Jan. 6 rally, warned Democrats that they would only embolden Trump supporters.“You believe that your hunger will be finally satiated by impeaching this president without completion of his full term of office,” Biggs said. “Instead of stopping the Trump train, his movement will grow stronger, for you will have made him a martyr.”The scene in the Capitol highlighted how fluid the political landscape has become one week before the departure of a president who has aggressively shaken up politics for four years. Cheney and Jordan were emerging as leaders of what are roughly anti- and pro-Trump factions of the GOP, with the party’s nominal leader, McCarthy, somewhere in the middle.Democrats, meanwhile, face what is likely to be Pelosi’s last term as speaker without a clear successor and with the narrowest congressional majority in decades — often a recipe for trouble as voters’ expectations exceed a party’s ability to deliver.In a sign of the House GOP’s tenuous political standing, McCarthy convened a call about two hours after the vote with his top financial donors. A slew of Fortune 500 companies in recent days have sworn off donations to the Republicans who voted to overturn the electoral college results, a group that includes McCarthy.McCarthy told the donors that he called Biden on Tuesday and “pledged to work together” with the new administration, according to a participant in the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private call.McCarthy also tried to reassure the wealthy contributors that he rejected the conspiracy theory that antifa was responsible for last week’s violence and said Trump deserved “some of the responsibility” for the attacks.The most immediate fallout from the impeachment effort appears likely to occur inside the Republican Party, as several Trump loyalists called for Cheney to immediately resign her leadership position. A petition for her resignation circulated among GOP offices in the Capitol as hard-right members seethed over her role in backing Trump’s ouster.Cheney on Wednesday insisted she would not resign: “I’m not going anywhere,” she told reporters. “Our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis. That’s what we need to be focused on.”Democrats, meanwhile, prepared for a new governing reality — with Biden assuming the presidency in a week and Democrats taking the narrowest of Senate majorities, with Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris poised to break 50-50 ties.With some Democrats openly floating a delay in transmission of the impeachment measure to allow the Senate to confirm at least some of Biden’s Cabinet nominees, Pelosi on Wednesday did not respond to questions about her plans.Some Republicans predicted that their internal bloodletting over Trump would soon be swept aside once Democrats take unified control in Washington.“We’re going to get through this, and we’re going to be united, because Speaker Pelosi is going to bring some very dangerous policy to the House floor that’s frankly going to divide them and unite us,” said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), a junior member of the party leadership.\n\nKaroun Demirjian and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.",

        "article": "The bipartisan impeachment vote in the House against President Trump on Wednesday set up a politically explosive reckoning for Senate Republicans, who spent four years enabling Trump’s behavior but in the wake of last week’s Capitol riot are grappling with how — or whether — to punish him with just seven days left in office.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe most striking position came from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said Wednesday that he will consider convicting Trump on inciting the attempted insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — a remarkable break between the two men who worked in lockstep for four years, even as the majority leader continually deflected questions about Trump’s untoward conduct and rhetoric.It was also a dramatic shift from his position during Trump’s first impeachment a year ago, when he publicly stressed that he was “not an impartial juror” and privately worked in concert with White House officials to map out the president’s eventual acquittal in the Senate.Read: Article of impeachment against President Trump“While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” McConnell said in a message to his colleagues, an excerpt of which was released by his office.The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach President Trump a second time after the deadly U.S. Capitol breach. (The Washington Post)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMcConnell also pressed pause on an impeachment trial that would occur before Trump leaves the White House on Jan. 20, slowing the rapid momentum and furor that snowballed in Congress as the scale and potential catastrophe of the Jan. 6 siege continued to sharpen.Even with McConnell’s position giving senators cover on a conviction, multiple senior GOP officials said it was too early to determine whether a critical mass of Senate Republicans would vote to punish Trump for his role in inciting a violent mob of his supporters to storm and rampage the Capitol, leaving five people dead.To convict Trump, 17 of the 50 Republicans in the new Senate would have to join the chamber’s 50 Democrats to meet the necessary two-thirds threshold. While a few GOP senators are now considered likely to oppose Trump, others across the spectrum of the party would face enormous pressure to abandon their years-long support of him and publicly rebuke him. Twenty GOP-held seats are on the ballot in 2022.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMost Republican senators have not expressed a public position on impeachment, leaving colleagues and others to try to parse their words for any hint of how they might feel. Some have directly criticized Trump for his role in inciting the riot, including Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who said Trump “bears responsibility” for the mayhem, and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who made similar comments.If two-thirds of the Senate convicted Trump, a second vote would determine whether he would be barred from ever seeking federal office again. A simple majority would determine that outcome.Given the parameters that guide Senate impeachment proceedings of a president, McConnell said Wednesday that Trump had “simply no chance” of a “fair or serious trial” before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in. His office informed aides to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) earlier Wednesday that he would not agree to immediately reconvene the Senate this week, according to a person familiar with the matter, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss internal GOP dynamics, despite pressure from Schumer to invoke rarely used emergency powers that allow the two Senate leaders to unilaterally reconvene.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Even if the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office,” McConnell said in a statement after the House impeached Trump on a bipartisan, 232-to-197 vote. “This is not a decision I am making; it is a fact.”McConnell is poised to remain majority leader until at least Jan. 22, when election results from the two Senate runoff races in Georgia will be certified and Democratic Sens.-elect Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will be eligible to be sworn in. McConnell and Schumer could jointly work out the rules that would govern Trump’s second impeachment trial, although once Democrats formally take the majority, Schumer and his ranks could formalize a rules package on a party-line vote.It's also unclear who would preside during a Senate impeachment trial of a former president. A Supreme Court spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday about whether Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been in contact with Senate leaders about any Senate proceedings, and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), in her role as president of the Senate, could conceivably preside.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith no apparent effort on McConnell’s part as of now to actively persuade or dissuade his colleagues on an impeachment vote, it was unclear how much political cover his position would provide — particularly as various Republican senators navigate their own personal home-state political dynamics as they weigh a Trump conviction.For nearly 24 hours, the outgoing majority leader had remained quiet to other GOP senators — even those seen as some of his closest lieutenants — on reports that he was pleased with the House’s move to rapidly impeach Trump and was leaning in favor of convicting him, according to Republican officials.That silence, people familiar with the matter said, frustrated some Senate Republicans who were seeking guidance or at least some insight into the majority leader’s thinking on what would be an unprecedented second impeachment trial of a U.S. president.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhile other increasingly vocal critics of the president emphasized that they, too, were open to conviction, allies of Trump within the Senate Republican Conference continued to line up in his defense — deepening a rift among GOP senators that began as Trump falsely amplified baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in the presidential election that he lost.Trump will almost certainly face a bigger rebuke than just the one Senate Republican — Mitt Romney of Utah — who voted to convict him last February. But the views of other GOP senators who flocked to Trump’s defense Wednesday underscored just how difficult it appeared to be as of now for 17 Republicans to ultimately decide to find him guilty of inciting an insurrection.Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said Wednesday after the House impeachment vote that for the past week, “it’s been obvious that the President was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Everything that we’re dealing with here — the riot, the loss of life, the impeachment, and now the fact that the U.S. Capitol has been turned into a barracks for federal troops for the first time since the Civil War — is the result of a particular lie,” Sasse said.He added that while he would not weigh in on the merits of impeachment because he is a juror, “President Trump has consistently lied by claiming that he ‘won the election by a landslide,’ and by promoting fanciful conspiracy theories about dozens of topics and people connected to the Nov. 3 election.”Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has emerged as one of the president’s fiercest critics since Trump lost reelection to Biden in November, said he continues to believe the outgoing president should immediately resign and, like McConnell, made clear he was also weighing a conviction.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office is debatable,” said Toomey, who plans to retire after his term. “Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump’s lawyers.”But a faction of the GOP conference continued to line up behind Trump, contending that a fraught impeachment fight would only be divisive and risk antagonizing supporters of the president who will still retain backing from a significant part of the party’s base.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who had remained an ardent Trump ally despite the turbulence of last week, reiterated that he opposes impeachment and said in a veiled reference to McConnell that “as to Senate leadership, I fear they are making the problem worse, not better.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“To my Republican colleagues who legitimize this process, you are doing great damage not only to the country, the future of the presidency, but also to the party,” Graham said. “The millions who have supported President Trump and his agenda should not be demonized because of the despicable actions of a seditious mob.”In private, some GOP senators questioned Democrats’ level of commitment in impeaching Trump, pointing to comments made by Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat, that suggested the House could simply hold off sending the article of impeachment to the Senate to delay a trial and free up floor time for members of Biden’s Cabinet to be confirmed.In McConnell’s message to senators Wednesday, obtained by The Washington Post, he acknowledged that he did not know when the House will transmit the articles to the Senate, though McConnell added that it could be shortly after it is adopted.Still, House Democrats want the Senate to act “as soon as possible,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said, signaling that the impeachment article was likely to be transmitted without delay. In a statement, Schumer promised that Trump will get a “fair trial” but added that Trump’s conduct “cannot and must not be tolerated, excused, or go unpunished.”Some Senate Republicans were also concerned that House Democrats were setting a precedent for a rushed impeachment of future presidents, according to people familiar with the conversations.“The House impeachment process seeks to legitimize a snap impeachment totally void of due process,” Graham said. “No hearings. No witnesses. It is a rushed process that, over time, will become a threat to future presidents.” \n\nErica Werner and Robert Barnes contributed to this report.",

        "article": "New York City is terminating its contracts with President Trump’s company to run a carousel, two ice rinks and a golf course in city parks, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Wednesday — calling it a response to Trump’s encouragement of a mob that ransacked the U.S. Capitol.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right“The President incited a rebellion against the United States government that killed five people and threatened to derail the constitutional transfer of power,” de Blasio said in a written statement. “The City of New York will not be associated with those unforgivable acts in any shape, way or form.”That decision — which will cut off the Trump Organization from businesses that bring in $17 million per year in revenue — makes New York the latest business partner to cut ties with Trump’s company.Story continues below advertisementIn a statement, Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the company would fight the move.Advertisement“The City of New York has no legal right to end our contracts and if they elect to proceed, they will owe The Trump Organization over $30 million dollars,” she said. “This is nothing more than political discrimination, an attempt to infringe on the First Amendment and we plan to fight vigorously.”Trump still owns his company, and his actions as president led him to be cut off by even longtime partners.Since Wednesday’s riot at the Capitol, the company has lost two of its banks, its e-commerce vendor and two of its real estate brokers. The company also lost its chance to host the prestigious PGA Championship golf tournament in 2022 and its hopes of hosting another major golf tournament in Scotland.Story continues below advertisementThat wide rejection comes at an awful time for Trump’s company, which was already struggling — with its hotels emptied by the pandemic and more than $400 million in unpaid loans looming.AdvertisementNow, experts say, Trump’s company will face that future without many of its key allies, and without some of its steady sources of income.The Washington Post reported earlier this week that New York City was considering this step, looking for legal means to cut off the contracts.Now, city officials said they had found those means, though they gave little details.They said that Trump’s contracts to run a carousel and two ice rinks in Central Park could be terminated in 25 and 30 days, respectively. The contract to run the Ferry Point golf course, in the Bronx, won’t be terminated for “a number of months,” the city said.Story continues below advertisementThe Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning. It has not responded to questions from The Post at any time this week.On Tuesday, the Associated Press said it had spoken to Eric Trump, who is the company’s de facto leader while his father is in office. The news service said Eric Trump had expressed no concerns about the company’s financial future. He blamed the decisions by the Trump Organization’s business partners on liberal “cancel culture.”“If you disagree with them, if they don’t like you, they try and cancel you,” Eric Trump said, according to the AP. Then, when an AP reporter asked Eric Trump if his father had incited the crowd that attacked the Capitol, there was silence and the line went dead.\n\n\n",

        "article": "In November — as President Trump began his effort to overturn the election he had lost — his longtime friend Tom Barrack called him with advice: Stop, for the sake of your business.The Trump Organization was already struggling, hurt by political backlash and coronavirus-related closures, facing huge unpaid loans. Barrack told Trump that he could help that business — as well as his aides, and the country itself —  by ensuring a peaceful transition, according to a person familiar with the conversation.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAn “elegant” exit, Barrack said, could preclude what could be a painful future: millions of dollars in legal costs, rampant investigations and more boycotts of his businesses.Story continues below advertisementTrump did not follow Barrack’s advice.Now, the Trump Organization is facing the consequences: In the past week, it has lost a bank, an e-commerce platform and the privilege of hosting a world-famous golf tournament, and its hopes of hosting another have been dashed. In the future, the Trump Organization also could lose its D.C. hotel and even its children’s carousel in Central Park, if government landlords in Washington and New York reevaluate their contracts with Trump.AdvertisementTrump lost a much bigger broker relationship Tuesday night when real estate giant Cushman & Wakefield told The Washington Post it would no longer work with him. The company has handled an array of business for Trump for many years, including office leasing at Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street, and retail leasing in Chicago. It means that Trump’s company will quickly have to find someone else to handle lease negotiations at some of his most prominent properties.“Cushman & Wakefield has made the decision to no longer do business with The Trump Organization,” the company said in a statement.Story continues below advertisementBy refusing to acknowledge that he would be returning to private life, Trump appears to have sabotaged what could have been his best chance at success in that realm — a rebound of the battered Trump brand.The Post’s Devlin Barrett outlines the potential charges President Trump and his legal team may face for inciting a mob to breach the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. (The Washington Post)Now, through his encouragement of rioters who ransacked the U.S. Capitol, Trump has made his company a pariah and driven away allies who could have brought it revenue and post-politics credibility.Advertisement“Most financial institutions and investors avoided doing business with him before he ran for president, and the situation now has only gotten worse,” said Kathryn Wylde, the leader of the Partnership for New York City, an influential group that includes the leaders of banks and Fortune 500 companies.Story continues below advertisementWylde was able to secure support for an open letter against Trump’s efforts to overturn the election from almost 200 major companies — including most of the major banks and real estate firms in New York — within 36 hours, a sign of how angry many are with his actions. That was before Jan. 6.“If he remains a visible player, no one will want to be associated with him in any kind of public way, because he is going to symbolize the destabilization of the American political system,” Wylde said.The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The White House declined to comment.AdvertisementOne senior administration official said Trump was particularly infuriated about the PGA of America’s decision to move the 2022 PGA Championship away from Trump’s Bedminster, N.J., golf course. Trump wanted to know what legal rights his company had to stop the organization from moving it.Story continues below advertisementThe official, speaking like some others on the condition of anonymity to comment candidly, said Trump had been a bit “shellshocked” at the corporate backlash to his comments preceding the attack on the Capitol.A former senior administration official said that Trump has long wanted regular updates on how his businesses are performing — particularly his Mar-a-Lago Club and the Bedminster golf club. “The happiest I saw the president was when all the biggest people in business were around him and kissing his ring,” the former official said, citing one particular event in Florida where real estate honchos and others each paid $580,000 to Trump’s campaign.AdvertisementTrump still owns his organization but has given day-to-day leadership to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. The company has not said what Trump’s role there will be after he leaves office Jan. 20.Story continues below advertisementEven if Trump had conceded his race to Biden without drama, he would have returned to a company that had been diminished — literally and metaphorically — since he took office in January 2017.Four Trump-branded hotels had closed. The company’s plans for new hotel chains had fizzled. The remaining hotels had been hit by political backlash, and then by the pandemic, which has devastated the hospitality industry: At Trump’s Chicago hotel in the fall, the managing director told investors, “It’s going to be very, very tough to keep the boat afloat.”The D.C. hotel’s BLT Prime restaurant had quietly lost its decorated chef, David Burke, who told The Post on Tuesday that he left in the fall after ESquared Hospitality, the New York-based company that operates the upscale steakhouse, ended his contract. Burke said it was probably because of the economics of the pandemic.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump has at times railed about business losses resulting from his being president, a senior administration official said, complaining in the Oval Office that the scrutiny and bad publicity were costing him “billions.”Trump also is facing state-level investigations into his financial practices in New York, and more than $400 million in loans will come due in the next few years.That was bad. But as of Election Day, Trump still had partners who could help him recover.Then came the attack on the Capitol.The first backlash fell upon, of all things, the Trump website that sells candles and T-shirts.TrumpStore.com had been hosted by the e-commerce website Shopify — until last week.Story continues below advertisement“Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence,” the company said. As of Tuesday evening, the site was still down.AdvertisementThen Trump lost the real estate broker working to sell his D.C. hotel. He lost the PGA Championship, one of golf’s four majors, which was scheduled to be played at his Bedminster, N.J., club in 2022. The event would have given him a massive spotlight in a sport he loves.In Britain, Trump’s hopes of landing another major golf tournament — the British Open — were dashed, as the organizers said they would not use Trump’s Turnberry club in Scotland for “the foreseeable future.”This week, Trump lost his accounts at New York’s Signature Bank, which gave back the money and put out a statement telling him to resign. New York City said it was “reviewing whether legal grounds exist” to terminate Trump’s contracts for ice rinks, the carousel and the city-owned golf course.Story continues below advertisementAlso Tuesday, Professional Bank — a Florida entity that lent Trump’s company $11.2 million in 2018 to buy the president’s sister’s home near Mar-a-Lago — said it would no longer do business with Trump.Advertisement“Professional Bank has decided not to engage in any further business with the Trump Organization and its affiliates, and will be winding down the relationship effective immediately,” the bank said in a statement. Trump also has a money market account at the bank worth at least $5 million, according to his most recent financial disclosure. The bank’s decision was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.That may not be the extent of Trump’s troubles.He still owes that $400 million, much of it to Deutsche Bank. Under normal circumstances, a borrower might seek to refinance or extend those loans, perhaps by getting a loan from a different bank. But experts say the former president is likely to have extreme difficulty finding a Wall Street bank willing to refinance properties that he controls.AdvertisementAt Deutsche Bank, which had bailed Trump out of financial hardships before, his personal banker resigned recently. And his existing loans with Deutsche Bank are on properties that have suffered severely from pandemic-related business closures. The New York Times reported that Deutsche Bank had determined it would not do business with Trump in the future. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment to The Post.Also, at one of Trump’s most troubled and debt-saddled properties, he will soon have a new landlord: the Biden administration.Trump’s D.C. hotel operates in the federally owned Old Post Office building under a contract with the federal government. For several years, therefore, Trump has effectively been his own landlord — and a fairly understanding one.Since Trump was elected, the General Services Administration, which oversees the lease, has approved his ownership — despite a clause saying the lease could not benefit an elected official  — and blocked House Democrats’ inquiries into the hotel. The GSA has said Trump is in compliance because he wasn’t an elected official when he signed the lease.One of those Democrats, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) said Tuesday that he hoped Biden’s team would release documents to show whether Trump derived improper benefits from the contract while president.“My Committee’s investigation has not ended — it was stonewalled. I expect our records requests to be honored by the Biden administration,” DeFazio said in a statement to The Post.Still, Trump’s D.C. hotel struggled: Company documents obtained by The Post said the hotel had been running nearly half-empty, even before the pandemic, The Post has reported. The company sought to sell the operation, then pulled it off the market after the novel coronavirus hit. Trump borrowed about $170 million from Deutsche Bank to renovate the building.Now some experts think the Biden administration may have grounds simply to revoke the lease, particularly if Trump runs into further legal trouble. One clause in the contract says Trump would be in violation if he is “under investigation by any government authority for alleged criminal activity” — meaning federal or D.C. agencies.Steven Schooner, an expert on contract law at George Washington University, said that should be enough.“By law and regulation, our government need only do business with contractors that ‘have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics,’ ” Schooner said. Schooner said Biden’s administration should sever the contract.“At a moment when major private-sector firms, concerned for their reputations, are publicly disassociating the Trump Organization like rats from a sinking ship, this isn’t rocket science,” he said.A Biden transition spokesman declined to comment.As of Tuesday night, Eric Trump had not tweeted at all since the day of the Capitol attack. The Trump Organization’s official Twitter account has been silent since Jan. 1, when it wished the world a happy new year.\n\n\nTim Carman contributed to this report.",

        "article": "ALAMO, Tex. — President Trump emerged Tuesday from six days out of public view defiant and unapologetic about his incitement of last week's mob attack on the Capitol and warned that his impeachment could lead to more violence.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe president denied any culpability in the violent riot that killed a police officer and threatened the lives of Vice President Pence and members of Congress. He said his remarks encouraging throngs of supporters last Wednesday to march to the Capitol in a show of force to pressure and intimidate lawmakers to overturn the election results were “totally appropriate.”During a visit to a portion of newly constructed border wall here in the Rio Grande Valley, Trump warned against the effort in Congress to hold him accountable.Story continues below advertisement“The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the U.S.A., especially at this very tender time,” Trump said.AdvertisementTrump for the first time addressed the calls from Democrats and even some Republicans for Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove him from office before his term expires.“The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration,” Trump said. “As the expression goes, ‘Be careful what you wish for.’ ”Story continues below advertisementWashington is seeing a heightened police and military presence in and around the city, and law enforcement authorities are bracing for future violence in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.Trump at first hesitated to tell his supporters to stand down when they stormed the Capitol. He was captivated by the spectacle playing out on live television and entranced by the notion that the rioters were fighting for him, people with knowledge of the events said. And when he issued a video last Wednesday afternoon telling the rioters to “go home,” he also declared his support for them by saying, “We love you.”AdvertisementTrump changed his tune here in Texas on Tuesday. Reading from a script, the president seemed to instruct his supporters not to rise up in violence. “Now is the time for our nation to heal. And it’s time for peace and for calm. Respect for law enforcement is the foundation of the MAGA agenda,” he said, referring to his “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.Story continues below advertisementEarlier Tuesday, Trump deflected a reporter’s question about his “personal responsibility” in the Capitol attack as he boarded Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews for the flight to Texas.“People thought what I said was totally appropriate,” Trump said, claiming that he had seen this view reflected across the media. In fact, he has been almost universally condemned for his remarks, including by many of his Republican allies.Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump’s failure to act after a mob stormed the CapitolTrump then drew a comparison to racial justice demonstrations last summer and suggested that other political leaders were more culpable for violence related to those events than he was for what happened at the Capitol last week.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“If you look at what other people have said — politicians at a high level — about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle, in various other places. That was a real problem, what they said,” Trump said. “But they’ve analyzed my speech and words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody, to the T, thought it was totally appropriate.”On Capitol Hill, however, some of Trump’s allies differed with that assessment as the drumbeat  for impeachment grew.The No. 3 Republican in the House, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, announced late Tuesday that she would vote to impeach Trump, saying there has “never been a greater betrayal” by a U.S. president.Story continues below advertisement“The president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence,” Cheney said in a statement. “He did not.”AdvertisementA spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he disagreed with Trump that his comments were “totally appropriate.” The spokesman added that McCarthy told House members on Monday that the president bore blame.And while a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to comment, a person who has spoken to him says he is open to convicting Trump in an impeachment trial and thinks the president is likely to have committed impeachable offenses but wants to hear evidence.Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement, “We all bear responsibility to reflect on the rhetoric leading up to the abhorrent violence of last week, including the president.”Story continues below advertisementTrump has resisted some entreaties to take responsibility for the mob, claiming that he did not know his supporters would literally storm the Capitol and that he did not want them to do so. He has dismissed concerns from his lawyers and other aides that he might have legal liability for his instigation, according to a senior administration official, who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal details.AdvertisementTrump continues to say privately that he won the election, another senior administration official said, but is no longer talking about trying to stay in office after his term has ended.Tim O’Brien, a Trump biographer, said that Trump’s first instinct always has been to lie and try to bulldoze his way through any sort of turmoil in his life — and that his response to the Capitol attack has been no different.Americans across the political spectrum fear what the Capitol attack portends“His father trained him to see the world only as winners and losers, and he’s never going to acknowledge he’s a loser,” O’Brien said. “He has no remorse and no regret about any of it. It’s what makes him such a damaged and damaging man. He doesn’t have any of the minimal guilt or regret that a healthy, stable individual has.”Story continues below advertisementLast week’s events have quickly made Trump a pariah. He is poised to be impeached for the second time — the first president in U.S. history to achieve that distinction — when the Democratic-led House brings an article of impeachment for a vote on Wednesday. Meanwhile, he has been silenced on social media because of messages from him that instigated violence, and he is being shunned by much of corporate America.AdvertisementA poll released Monday by Quinnipiac University found that Trump’s overall approval dipped to 33 percent, tied for the lowest the pollster has recorded, with majorities holding him responsible for the Capitol attack and favoring his removal from office or his resignation.Trump sought to escape this dark reality Tuesday by flying to the U.S.-Mexico border in a bid to burnish his presidential legacy as a crusader against illegal immigration. He toured a portion of the wall on the dusty banks of the Rio Grande, with soaring steel beams forming an imposing monument to his anti-immigrant agenda. Trump brandished a Sharpie and signed his autograph on a piece of the wall.Story continues below advertisementTrump’s hope is that history remembers him not for encouraging a coup against democracy, but for erecting a physical barrier to keep foreigners out — an apostle of law and order, as he sees himself.FBI report warned of ‘war,’ contradicting claims there were no sign of looming violence“He’s going to do anything and everything to leave a stamp of ‘Trump was here’ on the national body politic before he heads permanently to Mar-a-Lago,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said, referring to Trump’s Florida resort home.AdvertisementBut, Brinkley added, “anything Trump does now, he is a greatly diminished figure. He shrunk into Thumbelina size. He can act big at the wall, but he’s really tiny because of the way he publicly responded to the siege at the Capitol.”Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who traveled with the president Tuesday, spent four hours with him Friday helping to orchestrate the border wall trip and other events later this week. The objective, Graham said, is to give Trump daily obligations in his final full week as president and to “not look back on the past.”“We’ve laid out a plan for him, every day to do something,” Graham said.The Rio Grande Valley continues to be the busiest section of the border for illegal crossings. Although U.S. Customs and Border Protection identified these sections as its top priority for border wall construction, the Trump administration ended up building relatively few miles of new barriers there.AdvertisementA major impediment to construction efforts in the Rio Grande Valley has been resistance from local landowners. Most of the land the government needed to build new barriers is privately owned. In addition, some of the locations are on river levees, which adds to the expense and difficulty of construction.Instead, the administration has built hundreds of miles of barrier on public lands farther west, where the government already controlled the land but where there are comparatively fewer migrant crossings than in the Rio Grande Valley.David Lapan, a former senior official in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security, said the irony of Trump’s border-wall visit Tuesday was that the Capitol attack showed the more serious danger to the country comes from some of his own supporters, not from foreign migrants.“Rather than the threat being from Mexicans and Central Americans and people that cross the southwest border, we’ve seen evidence that the threat comes from within,” Lapan said. “The only thing he’s done about that threat is encourage it.”\n\nDawsey reported from Washington.

        "article": "When Donald Trump on Wednesday became the first president ever impeached twice, he did so as a leader increasingly isolated, sullen and vengeful.With less than seven days remaining in his presidency, Trump’s inner circle is shrinking, offices in his White House are emptying, and the president is lashing out at some of those who remain. He is angry that his allies have not mounted a more forceful defense of his incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol last week, advisers and associates said.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThough Trump has been exceptionally furious with Vice President Pence, his relationship with lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of his most steadfast defenders, is also fracturing, according to people with knowledge of the dynamics between the men.Story continues below advertisementTrump has instructed aides not to pay Giuliani’s legal fees, two officials said, and has demanded that he personally approve any reimbursements for the expenses Giuliani incurred while traveling on the president’s behalf to challenge election results in key states. They said Trump has privately expressed concern with some of Giuliani’s moves and did not appreciate a demand from Giuliani for $20,000 a day in fees for his work attempting to overturn the election.AdvertisementAs he watched impeachment quickly gain steam, Trump was upset generally that virtually nobody is defending him — including press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, economic adviser Larry Kudlow, national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, according to a senior administration official.“The president is pretty wound up,” said the senior administration official, who, like some others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. “No one is out there.”The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach President Trump a second time after the deadly U.S. Capitol breach. (The Washington Post)\n[Read: Article of impeachment against President Trump]\nStory continues below advertisementOne of Trump’s few confidants these days is Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who broke with the president last week over attempts to overturn the election only to be welcomed back in the president’s good graces a couple of days later. Graham traveled to Texas on Tuesday in what was Trump’s last scheduled presidential trip, spending hours with Trump aboard Air Force One talking about impeachment and planning how Trump should spend his final days in office.Advertisement“The president has come to grips with it’s over,” Graham said, referring to the election. “That’s tough. He thinks he was cheated, but nothing’s going to change that.”The president as pariah: Trump faces a torrent of retribution for his role in the Capitol siegeTrump asked Graham to lobby fellow senators to acquit him in his eventual impeachment trial, which Graham did from Air Force One as he worked through a list of colleagues to phone. A few senators called Trump aboard the presidential aircraft on Tuesday to notify him of their intent to acquit. During the flight home, Graham said, he tried to calm Trump after Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 House GOP leader, announced she would vote to impeach.“I just told him, ‘Listen, Mr. President, there are some people out there who were upset before and are upset now, but I assure you, most Republicans believe impeachment is bad for the country and not necessary and it would do damage to the institution of the presidency itself,” Graham recalled. He said he told Trump, “The people who are calling on impeachment are not representative of the [Republican] conferences.”Trump told reporters Tuesday that the drive toward impeachment was causing “tremendous anger” and posed a “tremendous danger to our country.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAlthough he has shown flashes of anger over his impeachment — and is livid with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for leaving open the possibility that he might vote to convict — Trump privately has told advisers that he does not believe he will be removed from office before his term expires Jan. 20, according to people familiar with the conversations.Many of the president’s advisers and outside associates share that mind-set. As one put it, “Whoop-de-do.”McConnell effectively guaranteed that outcome Wednesday, releasing a schedule after the House impeachment vote that would push a trial until after President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump’s failure to act after mob stormed the CapitolTrump has been more concerned with other actions that could have serious consequences for his post-presidential life, according to people familiar with the president’s concerns. The developments include Twitter and other social media companies suspending his accounts, the PGA of America canceling a golf tournament at one of his properties, and Deutsche Bank announcing it would no longer finance his developments.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump carried on with various activities Wednesday. As the House debated his impeachment, Trump issued a statement calling on his supporters to stand down.“In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” the statement said. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You.”Minutes after the House voted to impeach him for a second time, Trump held a private ceremony in the East Room to award the National Medal of Arts to country singer Toby Keith, a senior administration official said.President Trump on Jan. 13 said he \"unequivocally\" condemns the attack on the U.S. Capitol a week prior, adding that \"there must be no violence.\" (The White House)The White House released a video Wednesday evening featuring Trump seated behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office pleading with supporters not to engage in further violence. “Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,” he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementA senior administration official said Kushner, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino and Pence persuaded Trump to film the video, telling him it could boost support among weak Republicans. They asked him not to mention impeachment, and he didn’t.Still, in a stark illustration of Trump’s isolation, the White House did not mount a vigorous defense Wednesday as House members debated his fitness for office and, ultimately, voted to impeach him. The president’s aides did not blast out talking points to allies. His press secretary did not hold a briefing with reporters. His advisers did not do television interviews from the White House’s North Lawn. His lawyers and legislative affairs staffers did not whip votes or seek to persuade lawmakers to vote against impeachment.This is both because there was no organized campaign to block impeachment and because many of his aides believe Trump’s incitement of the riot was too odious to defend. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who was central to the president’s defense in his first impeachment a year ago, told other staffers to make sure word got out that he was not involved in defending Trump this time, according to one aide.“I just think this is the logical conclusion of someone who will only accept people in his inner orbit if they are willing to completely set themselves on fire on his behalf, and you’ve just reached a point to where everyone is burned out,” a senior administration official said. “Everyone is thinking, ‘I’ll set myself on fire for the president of the United States for this, for this and for this — but I’m not doing it for that.’ ”A former senior administration official in touch with the White House said in describing the staff mind-set: “People are just over it. The 20th couldn’t come soon enough. Sometimes there’s a bunker mentality or us-versus-them or righteous indignation that the Democrats or the media are being unfair, but there’s none of that right now. People are just exhausted and disappointed and angry and ready for all this to be done.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne of Trump’s only White House defenses came from Jason Miller, a senior political adviser. He did not defend the president’s conduct but rather argued that those who voted to impeach him would pay a political price. Miller sent reporters a two-page polling memo from Trump campaign pollster John McLaughlin saying that a majority of voters in presidential battleground states were opposed to impeachment and to “Big Tech censorship,” a reference to Twitter and other social media companies suspending Trump’s accounts.“It’s a massive miscalculation by the Democrats and the Liz Cheneys of the world who are massively disconnected from the grass roots that votes in primaries,” Miller said.Inside the remarkable rift between Donald Trump and Mike Pence“The grass roots and the base support is strong for him,” Miller added. “That’s really what matters. Washington is a very fickle town, and President Trump has never staked his strength as being in the nation’s capital. It’s always been out with the real people.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOther than family members, the president is mainly talking to Meadows, Scavino, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and personnel director Johnny McEntee. Hope Hicks, counselor to the president and long one of his closest confidantes, has been checked out for some time, according to people familiar with her status.Other than his trip to Texas, Trump’s public schedule has been empty, and he is said to be doing little these days besides watching television and fulminating with this coterie of loyalists about Republicans not defending him enough.Several aides laid blame for the situation not only on Trump but also on Meadows, because the chief of staff indulged Trump’s delusion that the election was rigged and fed him misinformation about alleged voter fraud.“He is the one who kept bringing kook after kook after kook in there to talk to him,” one adviser said.In the days after Twitter banned Trump from its platform, McEntee pushed the president to migrate to other social media sites, such as Parler. But Kushner and Scavino pushed back and stopped the president from joining the fringe platform, according to a person familiar with what happened who confirmed a CNN report.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSome current and former advisers described the impeachment as a sad ending that was unnecessary, propelled by a president who could not simply accept a loss and a vast array of aides willing to prop him up.Some of Trump’s longtime advisers, including Kellyanne Conway, lament that the president has not been able to use these final weeks to burnish his legacy.“From the time the electors certified the results to the time the president leaves office should have been spent reviewing and reliving the policy accomplishments of his four years and reminding Americans we are more peaceful or prosperous,” said Conway, a former senior counselor to the president who did not participate in the “Stop the Steal” activities aimed at overturning the election. “Instead of celebrating the accomplishments of the first term, we all watched in horror while the Capitol was run over.”Another former senior administration official, who has been briefed on some of the president’s recent private conversations, said Trump has expressed anger not only with Pence and some of his aides but also with longtime media defenders who have deserted him, including Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel, and others he believes have not fiercely defended him, including Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham.“He is feeling increasingly alone and isolated and frustrated,” this official said. “One of the metrics by which he’s often judged any number of things is: ‘Who’s out there saying good things about me or fighting on my behalf?’ And he never seemed to think there were enough people doing it strongly enough.”Now, in the final days, this official said, “it’s like death by a thousand cuts.”\n\n\n",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAnd that’s just in the past few days for President Trump, who after ruling Washington for nearly four years through a mix of bullying, intimidation, patronage and a sense that his willingness to spread falsehoods and misinformation would have no consequences is suddenly facing a torrent of retribution from those who long excused his behavior or were too scared or powerless to confront it.The fallout on Trump for his role in riling up thousands of supporters in a speech ahead of their deadly siege on the U.S. Capitol last week has intensified quickly — leaving the world’s most powerful leader as a pariah in many quarters, more isolated than ever.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump won 74 million votes in the November election — the second-most ever behind President-elect Joe Biden’s 81 million — but Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have cut him off from easily reaching those supporters in the real-time stream of explosive, demeaning and sometimes dangerous missives that have defined his presidency. Three banks, two real estate companies and the 2022 PGA Championship tournament have severed ties with the Trump Organization at a time when Trump and his family are facing mounting pressure from massive financial debts.Leaders in tiny Luxembourg canceled meetings with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Belgian leaders condemned the attack on the Capitol, prompting the top U.S. diplomat to scrap a final foreign trip to Europe this week. And some Republicans — beyond Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), the lone GOP lawmaker to buck Trump in January’s impeachment trial — voiced support for the second impeachment effort from Democrats on Wednesday.“There has never been a greater betrayal by a president,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking House Republican, said in a statement ahead of the vote. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reportedly floated the idea of censuring Trump, though he opposed impeachment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The House of Trump is unraveling, and it’s what happens when he’s about to lose power,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. “He was a bully president and so people were fearful of him, but with only a few days left in his tenure, people realize he’s about to be an ex-president with a boatload of legal suits and a brand that is no longer neon.”Backlash to riot hobbles Trump’s business as banks, partners flee the brandTrump and his allies lashed out at the widening condemnation. In remarks Tuesday in Alamo, Tex., where he toured a section of border wall, Trump declared that “free speech is under assault like never before,” positioning himself as a victim of the “greatest and most vicious witch hunt” in the nation’s history. Before the trip, the president insisted that his 70-minute address to supporters on Jan. 6 — in which he repeated false claims that he had won the election, implored Vice President Pence and McConnell to block Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory and urged supporters to march on the Capitol — was “totally appropriate.”Trump’s son Eric blamed the damage to the family business on liberal “cancel culture” ahead of Democratic New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s announcement Wednesday that the city would cut $17 million in contracts with the Trump Organization over operations of two ice rinks, a golf course and the Central Park Carousel.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It is something that they have been doing to us and others for years,” Eric Trump told the Associated Press. “If you disagree with them, if they don’t like you, they try and cancel you.” The younger Trump then abruptly hung up the phone when asked if the president had incited the crowd, the wire service reported.The moment has marked a dramatic turnabout for a president who had spent four years using his private resorts and golf courses — including Mar-a-Lago in South Florida and Trump International Hotel in Washington — as places of official government business, charging foreign governments and American taxpayers millions of dollars.Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump’s failure to act after mob stormed CapitolAnd despite his son’s eagerness to pin the notion of cancel culture on liberals, Trump has often governed as the canceler in chief, calling for boycotts of brands including Goodyear, Macy’s, Harley-Davidson, the National Football League and a host of media organizations.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFor years, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube resisted public pressure from liberal groups to moderate or suspend Trump’s accounts. In the wake of the Capitol siege, all three have blocked his access or taken them down, citing evidence that his posts were continuing to foment potential violence.“The platforms definitely didn’t want to be in this situation — they arrived here under unprecedented circumstances,” said Daphne Keller, a former legal adviser to Google who now works at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center. “The cynical way to look at it is that before the election, they were afraid to antagonize Republicans too much because Republicans could really punish them politically. After the election, the Republicans did not have as much power and it became politically easier. Then, the flash point last week provided a really clear moment when the decision seemed very justified to many people.”Keller cautioned, however, that the backlash to Trump has been limited to “an abrupt shift among elites” that has not yet been reflected in the president’s far-right base. The president also has maintained vocal support from most conservative lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close ally who briefly distanced himself from Trump last week but flew with him Tuesday to Texas on Air Force One.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAnd though Trump clashed with Pence over his insistence that the Constitution offered him no power to stop Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory, the vice president resisted calls from Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment that would allow the Cabinet a path to removing Trump from office.QAnon reshaped Trump’s party and radicalized believers. The Capitol siege may just be the start.Still, the rejection of Trump is hitting closer to home. Belichick, the Super Bowl-winning coach who Trump views as an ally, took the extraordinary step of declining his offer for the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Several high-ranking White House aides — including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf and deputy White House national security adviser Matthew Pottinger — have resigned in the wake of the siege.And McConnell on Wednesday left open the possibility of voting to convict Trump in the Senate after the House impeachment, saying in a statement that “I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOverseas, European leaders “will be extremely relieved to see the back end of the Trump administration,” Brookings Institution analyst Thomas Wright said. “It’s a combination of how they felt all along, but crucially, the events of the last week really did shock Europe and the world. They don’t see why they ought to pretend everything is fine.”Timothy L. O’Brien, author of the biography “TrumpNation,” said the backlash from Republicans, especially McConnell, is probably “creating vast wells of unquenchable resentment” in the president. He predicted Trump will seek revenge on GOP leadership by continuing to hold campaign-style rallies and supporting insurgent candidates.But O’Brien said it was the economic pain to Trump’s businesses — and the blows to his self-esteem through the loss of his social media platforms and snubs from the PGA and Belichick — that are probably more hurtful to him.“For someone who has had his nose pressed against the glass of public approval for most of his life over things that others find silly,” O’Brien said, “Donald Trump can’t live without them.”\n",

But I thought that certainly his position was, I think, extremely important at this moment, for a person who has an extremely high profile in the National Football League. And, frankly, I thought his statement was spot on.”Smith said it was significant that Belichick mentioned his discussions with his players.“He referenced standing with the players,” Smith said during a video conference call with reporters. “He referenced the conversations that have gone on in his locker room about social justice. And while he recognized that it was an award that has honored a number of extremely deserving people in the past, he felt that, at this time and at this moment in history, that he should decline.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe NFLPA also condemned last week’s violence and the actions of some political leaders, without mentioning any by name.“I just felt that we’re at a point now where we can certainly cheer about football and certainly cheer about what our members and the league have been able to accomplish this season,” Smith said. “But when we find ourselves having to question the loyalty of certain people toward our country, the oaths that they’ve taken to support our country, I think those are important questions for us to ask and certainly answer. ... We have not achieved in any way, shape or form a post-race America. And we now know that there are people out there who will continue to challenge what it means for this democracy to actually function.”Said JC Tretter, a center for the Cleveland Browns who is the NFLPA’s president: “We saw a sad day, a frightening day and an embarrassing one. It’s something [where] we need to be better. We need better from our elected leaders at this point. We are experiencing an extreme lack of leadership. And leaders are tasked with telling their constituents the hard truths, not what they want to hear. And right now we have a lot of those elected leaders who are very much caught up in what is best for their political career, what’s best for furthering themselves, and not what’s best for this country.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the waning days of his administration, Trump has chosen several sports figures to receive the Medal of Freedom, including former football coach Lou Holtz, who supported Trump during his 2016 campaign. The day after last week’s violence at the Capitol, he gave the award to golfers Annika Sorenstam, Gary Player and the late Babe Zaharias. In the past, the medal has been presented to recipients in a ceremony, but presentations since Trump’s election loss have taken place privately.The Medal of Freedom, created by John F. Kennedy in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made “an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.” The honor for Belichick was to come as the House of Representatives considers whether to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.After Belichick’s announcement, former Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi wrote on Twitter, “Proud to have played for this man.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn Massachusetts, the announcement of the award drew the kind of non-football-related scrutiny to which the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach is unaccustomed.“I would refuse it if I were Bill Belichick,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), whose district is in central Massachusetts, told CNN before Belichick’s announcement. “This president has made a mockery of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Bill Belichick should do the right thing and say, ‘No, thanks.’ ”PGA of America pulls PGA Championship from Trump’s N.J. golf courseMcGovern added earlier that he would be “very disappointed” if Belichick were to accept the medal.Story continues below advertisement“This president is not fit to be in office so anything that he would bestow on anybody to me is meaningless and to accept it is disgraceful,” he said.AdvertisementBelichick has served on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition since 2018.As he campaigned the day before the Nov. 8, 2016, election, Trump shared Belichick’s letter in a campaign appearance in Manchester, N.H., telling the crowd that Belichick had agreed to this rare glimpse into his personal correspondence.“Congratulations on a tremendous campaign,” Trump read. “You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully. You’ve proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter. Your leadership is amazing.

There’s also a reason the R&A, which owns and operates the British Open, made a point Monday of saying it didn’t have President Trump’s Turnberry course, the iconic scene of several historic Opens, on its future schedule even before the events of last week.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt’s because both organizations — but especially the PGA — know many of their members still stand firmly behind the outgoing president, even after a mob of his supporters, fueled by his words, laid siege to the Capitol.That’s why PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh repeatedly emphasized that he and the PGA’s executive board “had to make a business decision” to protect “our brand and reputation” in announcing Sunday night that it would seek a new venue for next year’s PGA Championship. It’s also why PGA of America President Jim Richerson ducked the question when asked Monday on Golf Channel whether the board’s vote had been unanimous.PGA of America pulls PGA Championship from Trump’s N.J. golf courseThe R&A didn’t have as difficult of a decision to make because it didn’t have an upcoming British Open scheduled at what is now known as “Trump Turnberry.” The championship was last played there in 2009, when 59-year-old Tom Watson came within inches of being the oldest man to win a major title. It was also the site of Watson’s “Duel in the Sun” with Jack Nicklaus in 1977 and Greg Norman’s first major victory in 1986.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNormally, Turnberry would have been in the championship rota sometime about now, but the R&A backed away from the course after Trump bought it in 2014. The R&A cited logistical issues getting into and out of the course — which are quite real but have been overcome in the past — for not returning, even though Turnberry is considered one of the United Kingdom’s two or three best championship venues.“We had no plans to stage any of our championships at Turnberry and will not do so in the foreseeable future,” R&A Chief Executive Martin Slumbers said in a statement Monday. “We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself. We do not believe that is available in the current circumstances.”In other words, “we’re not doing business with Donald Trump” — at least right now.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMost American golf entities have had little problem doing business with Trump in the past. The U.S. Golf Association staged the 2017 U.S. Women’s Open at the same Trump course where the PGA was to be played next year. Later in 2017, the PGA Tour held its Senior Players Championship at Trump’s course in Virginia’s Loudoun County. After playing an event at Doral for 45 years, the tour left the Miami property several years after Trump acquired it, not because it objected to Trump’s politics but because it needed corporate sponsorship. That event moved to Mexico.Trump’s response, on Sean Hannity’s Fox show: “By the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance.”It’s unlikely the PGA of America would have moved next year’s PGA if not for last week’s events at the Capitol. Talk to people in the golf world who have dealt with Trump, and they will tell you that losing the PGA Championship and knowing he isn’t going to get a British Open probably make him almost as angry as losing the election.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSince this week’s announcements, the silence coming from tour players has been deafening. Jack Nicklaus, an outspoken supporter of Trump before the election, has been silent, as has Tiger Woods — golf’s greatest players.Sally Jenkins: Trump offered Bill Belichick an honor. Duty compelled him to refuse.Woods accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump in 2019. The day after the invasion of the Capitol, two more Hall of Fame golfers — Gary Player and Annika Sorenstam — accepted the same honor from Trump. But on Monday, New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said he would not accept the award from Trump as scheduled.Since the killing of George Floyd, many in the sports world have spoken out on racial inequality and social justice. Kneeling for the national anthem, which Trump railed against in the past, became a more frequent occurrence in team sports. Two days after the Capitol riot, after consulting with his players, Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr joined them in kneeling during the anthem in direct response to Wednesday’s events. Kentucky Coach John Calipari and his players did the same thing Monday.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt is not a coincidence that White coaches — such as Kerr, Calipari, the San Antonio Spurs’ Gregg Popovich, Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski and Belichick — have taken stances against Trump. They have spent their lives working with Black colleagues. Golfers rarely do.The PGA of America is made up of 28,000 club pros, men and women who teach the sport and sell golf equipment out of pro shops. The PGA Tour, with which it’s often confused, is made up of the sport’s elite players, good enough to play the game for a living.The two groups were a single entity before those playing the tour broke away and formed their own organization in 1968.

Sixty years later, the lateness of that moment is still significant.Barry Svrluga: It's time for golf to make a break with TrumpAccording to the PGA of America, 167 of its 28,000 club pros — less than 1 percent — are Black. According to the tour, three full-fledged tour members are Black: Woods, Harold Varner III and Cameron Champ. And if those White tour players and club pros voted in November, they most assuredly did so for Trump.AdvertisementIn a very real sense, golf has been Trump’s escape hatch from the realities of his crumbling political life, both when he plays the game and in the support he continues to receive from many who play at the highest level.Story continues below advertisementBut Trump’s future in golf is now, at the least, murky. Regardless of what he does after he leaves office, he will remain a polarizing figure. Sponsors aren’t likely to rush to put their names on events associated with Trump. No golf organization is going to want to face the almost certain protests that would occur at a Trump golf course during a major event.Backlash to riot at Capitol hobbles Trump’s business as banks, partners flee the brandTrump has spent massive amounts of money acquiring and building golf courses — he now owns 17 of them. He made it clear that his dream was to host as many major events at as many of his courses as possible.Now, even though many in the golf world are still Trump supporters, he is radioactive. Chances are he will continue to push golf’s leadership to let him back into their world. They are also likely to be pushed in that direction by many of their members — club pros and tour pros.Trump will never go away quietly. And if there is one sport where he might be welcome again someday, it is, without a doubt, golf.",

And Trump defended his speech in front of a mob last week that later stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent, failed insurrection that left lawmakers on lockdown, stressing even its controversial parts were “totally appropriate.”Trump’s renewed attacks come as House Democrats plan to ramp up their scrutiny of Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. Party lawmakers in recent days have faulted tech giants for acting too slowly to stop Trump’s online rhetoric from precipitating real-world chaos.These are the platforms that have banned Trump and his allies“There’s no question that our committee is going to investigate and have hearings on the whole issue that we’ve been dealing with, in terms of what they can do on their platforms,” said Rep.

(Reuters)Facebook, Twitter could face punishing regulation for their role in U.S. Capitol riot, Democrats sayDemocratic lawmakers for years have called on Facebook, Google and Twitter to take a more aggressive approach to a wide array of harmful content online, including election-year disinformation and hate speech. All three tech giants in response have invested heavily in hiring thousands of workers and developing fresh artificial-intelligence tools to spot and remove more problematic posts, photos and videos before they can go viral. But the tech industry’s efforts have not come fast enough for many policymakers in Washington, who repeatedly have threatened stiff regulation to come.The assault on the Capitol last Wednesday that forced lawmakers into lockdown and left five dead has injected new energy into calls for reform. Democrats say Facebook and Twitter should have acted sooner to ban Trump, well before his attacks on the 2020 election threatened to incite real-world violence. Some party members in recent days have revived their campaign to rethink Section 230, a decades-old law that spares a wide array of sites and services — from newspapers to tech giants — from being held liable for the content their users post.Trump scrambles to find new social network after Twitter ban, as White House prepares to blast big techThe new congressional scrutiny comes as Facebook, Twitter and their tech peers continue to face blowback for their sudden decisions to take aim at Trump and some of his most controversial allies ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTrump’s aides say they expect him to call out Silicon Valley over claims of censorship in the final days of his term.

They seized the people’s house as politicians cowered under desks. Hordes wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the “Q” symbol and toting Trump flags closed in to deliver justice, armed with zip-tie handcuffs and rope and guns.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe “#Storm” envisioned on far-right message boards had arrived. And two women who had died in the rampage — both QAnon devotees — had become what some were calling the first martyrs of the cause.The siege ended with police retaking the Capitol and Trump being rebuked and losing his Twitter account. But the failed insurrection illustrated how the paranoid conspiracy theory QAnon has radicalized Americans, reshaped the Republican Party and gained a forceful grip on right-wing belief.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBorn in the Internet’s fever swamps, QAnon played an unmistakable role in energizing rioters during the real-world attack on Jan. 6. A man in a “Q” T-shirt led the breach of the Senate, while a shirtless, fur-clad believer known as the “Q Shaman” posed for photographers in the Senate chamber. Twitter later purged more than 70,000 accounts associated with the conspiracy theory, in an acknowledgment of the online potency of QAnon.QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory, is fueled by right-wing outrage online and in the real world. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)The baseless conspiracy theory, which imagines Trump in a battle with a cabal of deep-state saboteurs who worship Satan and traffic children for sex, helped drive the day’s events and facilitate organized attacks. A pro-Trump mob overwhelmed Capitol Police officers, injuring dozens, and one officer later died as a result. One woman was fatally shot by police inside the Capitol. Three others in the crowd died of medical emergencies.QAnon devotees joined with extremist group members and white supremacists at the Capitol assault after finding one another on Internet sanctuaries: the conservative forums of TheDonald.win and Parler; the anonymous extremist channels of 8kun and Telegram; and the social media giants of Facebook and Twitter, which have scrambled in recent months to prevent devotees from organizing on their sites.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementQAnon didn’t fully account for the rampage, and the theory’s namesake — a top-secret government messenger of pro-Trump prophecies — has largely vanished, posting nothing in the past 35 days and only five times since Trump’s election loss.But QAnon’s prominence at the Capitol raid shows how powerful the conspiracy theory has become, and how quickly it has established a life of its own. On fringe right-wing platforms and encrypted messaging apps, believers are offering increasingly outlandish theories and sharing ideas for how they can further work to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 contest — with violence, if necessary.The fervent online organizing seen ahead of last week’s assault has begun building again. A QAnon group on Gab has grown by more than 40,000 members since the failed insurrection. Thousands more have flocked to QAnon-affiliated spaces on the private-messaging app Telegram. One 12,000-member channel was so overrun with new members that those behind the forum temporarily froze the chat feature.Even as Trump is set to exit the White House, QAnon’s grip on the conservative psyche is growing. Two freshmen Republican members of Congress, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) and Lauren Boebert (Colo.), have voiced support for QAnon, while others have tweeted its slogans. State legislators across the country have further lent it credence while also backing Trump’s claims of electoral theft despite a lack of evidence and dozens of swift rejections in court.The QAnon movement’s evolution, from an Internet hodgepodge to a hallmark of pro-Trump violence, is a signal of the danger it poses to security this weekend and going into next week’s inauguration. It also presents long-term challenges for President-elect Joe Biden by fomenting resistance to democratic governance and to measures needed to corral the coronavirus pandemic, including mass vaccination.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The takeaway from this is that disinformation is a threat to our democracy,” said Joel Finkelstein, co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, a research group that studies online disinformation. “And we’re not nearly done.”As much of the nation — including leading Republicans — expressed horror at last week’s events, a different narrative was playing out in the parallel online universe that has grown around Trump’s presidency and helped sustain it through perpetual upheaval. The siege was justified, described on Twitter by one QAnon devotee as “the least we can do.” Or it was staged as a false flag to discredit Trump supporters, with its participants as the true victims.“You all know the attack on the Capitol was done by [the far-left political movement] antifa,” Thomas McInerney, a retired lieutenant general in the Air Force, declared in remarks captured on video and peppered across Twitter by accounts participating in a frenzied effort to construct a different narrative of the Capitol riots.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementExperts tracking the QAnon conspiracy theory movement believe a new president may only exacerbate feelings of resentment and victimhood that have nurtured the baseless philosophy. Against the backdrop of QAnon, Trump was able to position himself as an outsider, fending off secret enemies, even while in the Oval Office. Once he’s really on the outside, that sense could grow.“This will be a new cause,” said Mary B. McCord, a Georgetown Law professor and former national security official at the Justice Department. “Democrats in the White House.”Capitol siege was planned online. Trump supporters now planning the next one.From online to the real worldIn 2017, a writer on the anonymous message board 4chan, styling themselves as Q, wrote posts spinning a dark and cryptic fantasy — detailing how Trump was working tactically to dismantle the “deep state” cabal that controls much of the world.For years, QAnon spun a tale in the militant language of good against evil, promising that Trump, a soldier messiah, would strike down a global cabal of pedophile politicians and Satanist media elites in a day of reckoning called the “Storm.” The siege, for some believers, was seen as that online theory coming to life.As its online infrastructure expanded from a single message board to a network of aggregators, chat rooms and social-network bubbles, QAnon, which originally mimicked much of the debunked conspiracy theory Pizzagate, mushroomed into an umbrella conspiracy theory. It encapsulated all manners of disparate right-wing beliefs: vaccine skepticism, anti-Semitic ideas about government control and, most recently, the unsubstantiated belief that Biden’s election win was a fraud.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn recent months, it has become challenging to know where QAnon’s world ends and Trump’s begins. QAnon T-shirts and banners are a constant presence at Trump’s rallies, and pro-Trump figures are exalted by QAnon believers as heroes.Twitter bans Trump’s account, citing risk of further violenceTrump has rarely explicitly acknowledged QAnon, which has been linked by law enforcement to intensifying real-world violence, although believers have often celebrated when he has retweeted the conspiracy theory’s best-known promoters. In August, when Trump was asked whether he believed QAnon’s core claims that he was “secretly saving the world from this cult of pedophiles and cannibals,” Trump replied, “If I can help save the world from problems, I am willing to do it. … We are actually, we’re saving the world.”Asked about the fringe conspiracy theory QAnon on Aug. 19, President Trump said he knew little of the group beyond \"they like me very much.\" (The Washington Post)Q’s relative quiet since the election has led some believers toward a crisis of faith on whether Q had abandoned the flock. But many still call on their fellow adherents to “trust the plan”: “Do not mistake silence for inaction,” says one site that sends alerts whenever Q posts a new “intelligence drop.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMuch of QAnon devotees’ energy has in recent months flooded to false allegations that Trump had been robbed of an election victory. The QAnon-boosting attorneys Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood led a failing pro-Trump attempt to overturn the election.The QAnon conversation online had pivoted from taking down a global cabal to targeting a more specific mission: “Stop the Steal.” So when Trump invited supporters to Washington for mass demonstrations on Jan. 6, the day Congress was set to certify Biden’s victory, researchers said pro-Trump agitators and QAnon believers saw it as a demand for action.“Be there,” Trump tweeted last month. “Will be wild!”How QAnon shaped the siegeRosanne Boyland was prepared to take the president literally, traveling from Georgia to “keep the fight alive,” as she wrote on Facebook this month.Backlash to riot at Capitol hobbles Trump’s business as banks, partners flee the brandShe was in Washington when Trump addressed his supporters last week near the White House, urging them to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe 34-year-old woman was among four participants in the pro-Trump action who died. Two of them, including Boyland, were QAnon devotees, according to family members and a review of their digital footprints. On Facebook, Boyland reposted content from popular QAnon personas and praised members of the Trump administration seen as working most avidly to bring about Q’s promised salvation. Facebook in October removed QAnon pages and groups, citing links to real-world harm, but permitted individual QAnon posts so long as they didn’t violate other policies, such as the ban on inciting violence.The other was Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran shot by police in the Capitol. Both women have been mourned as martyrs to QAnon, with Babbitt described on Twitter as a patriot whose “heart was pumping with fire and hope.” Anonymous accounts have swarmed tweets by Republican politicians telling them to “show support for our fallen MAGA patriots.”Others involved in the Capitol breach proudly wore their devotion to QAnon. Douglas A. Jensen, the man who authorities say led a pack of rioters into the Senate, wore a shirt with a giant “Q” rendered in red, white and blue. He was arrested Saturday on federal charges, including trespassing and obstructing a law enforcement officer.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementJacob Anthony Chansley, the “Q Shaman” who was later charged for his involvement in the riots, told the FBI he had come as part of a group from Arizona “at the request of the President that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C.” on Jan. 6.Jo Rae Perkins, a QAnon adherent who ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Oregon last year, wrote on Twitter that she had been present at the Capitol for “over three hours.” She added the rally cry “#TheStormHasArrived,” invoking the day of reckoning associated in the QAnon canon with the mass arrest of Democrats.For some Christians, the Capitol riot doesn’t change the prophecy: Trump will be presidentQAnon, said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, “is one major point in a constellation of right-wing terrorist movements that also includes ‘boogaloo,’ militia movements, white supremacists, neo-Nazis.”Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on and soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said QAnon’s ability to “weave together — and thereby recruit from — a wide constellation of existing conspiracy theories and causes has brought these dangerous beliefs more into the mainstream.”QAnon believers, in videos and posts about the siege, said they felt invigorated by the starring role they had played in battling their hero’s enemies. Tamara Towers Parry, a Seattle woman who goes by the name “Dr. Tammy,” had voiced her devotion to QAnon with posts and videos on her since-suspended Twitter account in which she said Q would one day “be in every history book.”As QAnon grew, Facebook and Twitter missed years of warning signs about the conspiracy theory’s violent natureAfter the siege, she posted another video outside the Capitol, where she wore an American-flag cowboy hat and gripped a large “Q” flag.“We just stormed the Congress, and I’m going to tell you right now, it was wild,” she said. She narrated the action as she clambered past broken windows and dodged clouds of tear gas. “Our eyes are burning, but you know what, compared to what our Founding Fathers did, it’s the least we can do.” Parry did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment.Then she voiced a signature QAnon belief — that Biden, among other Democratic leaders, would soon go to prison.“God bless America,” she said into the camera, flashing a big smile.The coming stormThe next wave of mayhem is expected to arrive this weekend, possibly extending into Inauguration Day on Wednesday. One video circulating widely on YouTube and elsewhere offered a mash-up of Trump speeches that culminates in a call to Washington as Biden is sworn in, promising “PANIC IN DC.”This time, authorities are taking these warnings seriously, with heavy police presences and up to 15,000 National Guard members planned to help keep the peace.In the siege’s aftermath, when Trump acknowledged there would be a transfer of power on Jan. 20, some QAnon adherents saw a final betrayal — although others, trusting Q’s plan, said they saw in it a coded message that Trump would not actually cede control.At the same time, the fervor among QAnon supporters appears not to have ebbed, even as arrests mount. A mix of excitement and fear pushed QAnon believers further into their alternative digital reality. One QAnon-affiliated account with more than 11,000 subscribers on Telegram posted a list of emergency resources the night of the failed insurrection, including survival guidebooks and documents detailing firearms and physical training in isolation.QAnon believers doubled down on their worldview, offering contradictory and nonsensical theories for the week’s events: The siege was instigated by undercover Black Lives Matter and antifa activists, they said, but pro-Trump operatives seized the opportunity to steal laptops they said would contain evidence of widespread sex trafficking among elites.Another theory posited that Trump’s comments on Thursday about a “smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power” were not about an incoming Biden administration but about imminent military rule led by Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, whose Twitter account was suspended last week as part of the platform’s widening ban on QAnon content.‘The storm is here’: Ashli Babbitt’s journey from capital ‘guardian’ to invaderAfter the siege, the administrator of a smaller far-right Telegram channel promoted the use of untraceable 3-D-printed gun parts and posted the locations for the headquarters of Twitter, Facebook, Google and Apple.The response by Republican leaders makes it unknown which direction the party will go. Even those no longer in office, and no longer subject to the will of pro-Trump voters, have not always been full-throated.“A sad day,” wrote Tom Graves, Greene’s predecessor in Congress. “Not who we are to be.” When invited to say more, he did not take the opportunity.But while members of Congress have stayed silent about QAnon, its believers have pushed for more aggressive action. The raft of suspensions across social media targeting QAnon-related accounts — as well as the ban of Trump’s Twitter account — led some to claim the U.S. military was launching a global media blackout, the first phase of a cryptic operation they believed would climax with thousands of arrests and live-streamed military tribunals exposing the crimes of the political elite.“We are safe from the blackout here,” wrote one user, “Digital Soldier,” on Telegram.Most theories converged on a key point for QAnon, which over years of missed deadlines for an impending conquest by Trump has hinged on promoting and anticipating some new blockbuster event: that Trump was going to drop reality-shifting intelligence in the days and weeks ahead.“The reason we had to go through all this drama,” one user posted on Telegram, “was for people to become aware, angry and ready to look at the evidence and demand justice.”Julie Tate contributed to this report.",

        "article": "It started with a soaring speech at the National Space Council by Vice President Pence that laid out an ambitious if improbable goal: NASA astronauts would return to the surface of the moon and do it by 2024. Pence’s declaration in 2019 that NASA would accelerate its schedule by four years made big headlines and sent shock waves through NASA and the space industry as he pledged that the agency would meet the mandate “by any means necessary.”Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightNow, as the Trump administration departs in defeat, it is clear that the 2024 deadline will not be met, and was likely never an achievable goal, despite having the backing of the White House and a massive lobbying effort by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.To meet the White House’s mandate, which moved up the moon landing from 2028, Bridenstine had said that the agency would need $3.3 billion in next year’s budget to build the first spacecraft capable of landing astronauts on the moon since the Apollo era of the 1960s. With Pence’s backing, he crisscrossed the country and the halls of Congress, urging lawmakers to support the agency’s Artemis mission, which, as he pledged in his campaign-like stump speech, would put the “next man and first woman on the moon.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCongress came through — but with $850 million, well short of the full request. And so now, the 2024 goal will  not be met.“In order to make the 2024 goal, everything in the sequence leading up to it had to go right,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. “And in programs like this, that doesn’t usually happen.”The 2024 deadline has “been dead for a while, I’m not sure it was ever alive,” he said. “It was what we call in the trade an aspirational goal.” Still, he said the effort has galvanized an agency that has not returned to the lunar surface since the last Apollo mission in 1972 and has only recently resumed flying astronauts from American soil to Earth orbit.Story continues below advertisement“It energized NASA and its contractors to put more intensity into what they were doing,” Logsdon said.AdvertisementBridenstine, whose leadership inspired an online fan club, was praised for his work to build bipartisan support for Artemis. And unlike other unfulfilled promises of the Trump administration — a border wall that didn’t get fully built or the failure to replace the Affordable Care Act with a viable alternative — the effort to return astronauts to the moon is likely to continue under the Biden administration, Republicans and Democrats say, though on a different timeline.Amid a tumultuous election, rioting at the Capitol and a deadly pandemic, Biden has said nothing about his plans for the space program. The transition team has not yet announced who it would nominate for administrator, though Democrats have said it is likely to be the first woman to ever occupy the position. Under Biden, the agency will focus more on Earth science, party officials said, and note that its party platform says, “We support NASA’s work to return Americans to the moon and go beyond the Mars, taking the next step in exploring our solar system.”Story continues below advertisementIn an interview, Bridenstine, who will step down from NASA on Jan. 20, would not declare the 2024 deadline dead quite yet, though he did say that given the shortfall in funding, NASA “is going to have to go back to the drawing board.”AdvertisementStill, the Artemis program “is on solid footing. It is absolutely true that we didn’t get every dollar we requested, and that will make us reevaluate what the plan ultimately looks like,” he said. “But the fact that in the midst of a very challenging year, Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate said we want to fund a human landing system at $850 million — that’s a solid victory.”In addition to lobbying lawmakers, Bridenstine has successfully courted several international partners in the effort, such as Japan, Australia and Canada, which are committing resources and signing a document known as the Artemis Accords that governs behavior on and around the moon. A broad international coalition, such as the one that governs the International Space Station, will provide continuity from one administration to the next, said Wayne Hale, a former NASA flight director, who now chairs an advisory committee.Story continues below advertisement“This administration has very smartly instituted the Artemis Accords, which binds us with other nations,” he said. “And that I think is going to continue to motivate the administration that follows to carry on that project.”AdvertisementNASA has also highlighted the astronauts who would fly on the Artemis missions — giving a face to the program and a hint of who the first woman to walk on the moon might be. But there are still numerous challenges that the Biden administration will inherit.The Space Launch System, NASA’s massive rocket that would fly astronauts to the moon, has never flown. And while it has in recent months made significant progress, it has over the years suffered many setbacks and delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns. If all goes well at a major test of its engines Saturday, the rocket’s first flight, known as Artemis I, is expected to come late this year, propelling the Orion spacecraft, without any astronauts on board, in a mission around the moon.  If the test is successful,  NASA would then work to put a crew of astronauts in orbit around the moon for Artemis II, before the Artemis III landing.Story continues below advertisementGiven that the Space Launch System is a massive, complex rocket, the most powerful ever built, and has never flown before, the current schedule may be very optimistic.Advertisement“NASA announces, without any kind of doubt, that Artemis I, II and III are going to go off without a hitch. If you look at SLS, it is a very complicated rocket,” said Homer Hickam, the author and a member of the National Space Council’s advisory committee. “The odds are it’s not going to work perfectly on the first launch. And if it doesn’t work perfectly, are you really going to put a crew on the second time?”NASA has already awarded nearly $1 billion in contracts to three companies for the initial development of spacecraft capable of landing astronauts on the lunar surface. A team led by Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin that includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper won $579 million, the biggest amount. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Dynetics, which teamed with Sierra Nevada Corp., was awarded $253 million, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX got $135 million.Story continues below advertisementThose contracts run out in February, and the second phase, in which NASA is expected to eliminate at least one of the bidders and continue with the others, would come shortly afterward. But some fear that will be delayed, as Democrats take office and assess NASA’s programs.AdvertisementBridenstine said that delays could hinder the momentum the program has and that he hoped that would not happen.“I don’t think that would be in the interest of the agency or the program,” he said. “I haven’t heard that’s what they’re planning to do. But the goal is to go fast. That’s how you create a program that’s successful.”Even if the contracts aren’t delayed, he said the agency is going to have to reassess the 2024 timeline: “I think it’s important to give the team time to assess what the future might look like.”",

That latitude and pro-free speech stance was extended even further with politicians. Twitter — like Facebook — has long given exemptions to public figures regarding their hate speech policies on the grounds that what they said was newsworthy and worthy of public debate. The decisions last week, to effectively silence those voices, Dorsey pointed out, would have huge ramifications.“They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning,” he wrote. “And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.”Rachel Lerman contributed to this report.",

The papers bear the imprint of the Executive Office of the President and state that they were copyrighted by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).But they were never approved by Kelvin Droegemeier, the director of the office.NOAA taps David Legates, professor who questions the seriousness and severity of global warming, for top role“Dr. Droegemeier was outraged to learn of the materials that were not shared with or approved by OSTP leadership,” OSTP spokeswoman Kristina Baum said in an email Tuesday afternoon. “He first became aware of the documents when contacted by the press. As a result, Dr. Droegemeier took swift action and the individuals responsible have been relieved of their duties at OSTP.”Baum had stated Monday night that the papers, which make controversial and disputed claims about climate science, were not created at OSTP’s direction or cleared by its leadership. She said Tuesday morning that the science and technology arm of the White House “has no intention to formalize these” by publishing them on the agency’s site.The dismissal of Legates and Maue from OSTP means they will return to NOAA, where they were first hired. Both Legates’s and Maue’s last day working for the Trump administration is this week.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementScott Smullen, deputy director of NOAA communications, said the publication of the documents will be reviewed under the agency’s scientific integrity policy. He distanced the agency from the documents, known as the “Climate Change Flyers.”“Science papers from NOAA follow a rigorous peer-reviewed process under agency regulations on scientific publications. NOAA was not involved in the creation or posting online of the climate change flyers that have been allegedly attributed to the Office of Science and Technology Policy, nor does NOAA endorse the flyers. OSTP is investigating the issue,” Smullen said in a statement.The papers include the claim that subscribing to the idea of human-caused global warming “involves a large measure of faith” and that computer models are “too small and slow” to produce meaningful climate simulations.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLegates, who led the production of the papers, did not reply to requests for comment regarding why the papers were published bearing the seal of the Executive Office of the President when they had not been approved by the White House.Legates, a climate skeptic and climatology professor at the University of Delaware, has been a mysterious figure at NOAA since he started working there in September. Shortly after joining the agency he was detailed to a position overseeing the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which coordinates federal climate change research, while remaining a NOAA employee.Some at NOAA feared that Legates, who has a long history of contributing to the Heartland Institute and its efforts to cast doubt on mainstream climate science findings, was working on a pet project, possibly one that could be harmful to NOAA’s climate research programs.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Climate Change Flyers consist of nine two- to 10-page essays that question the reliability of computer models, the human-induced causes of climate change, and links between climate change and hurricanes among the topics covered.“These flyers have been written by top scientists from leading institutions from around North America,” says the series introduction, written by Legates. “The Office of Science and Technology Policy is pleased to bring you these briefs to further your understanding of climate change by learning from these learned scholars.”White House taps second controversial scientist to steer major U.S. climate change reportThere is no information provided regarding whether the essays were peer-reviewed or the process for developing them.Story continues below advertisementJohn Holdren, who headed the OSTP during Barack Obama’s presidency, characterized the fliers as “misguided and thoroughly erroneous screeds” and said they “would not have been issued by anybody with a shred of scientific integrity.”AdvertisementHoldren also called for Legates to be fired.One essay, titled “Systematic Problems in the Four ‘National Assessments’ of Climate Change Impacts on the United States,” tries to discredit all the U.S. government’s previous authoritative reports, which were subject to multiple rounds of peer review, including by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences.Legates was appointed by the White House to oversee the next such assessment, which is slated to be published in 2023.Trump administration official who questions global warming will run key climate programThe papers are probably intended to influence the 2023 assessment, according to Myron Ebell, a climate skeptic close to the Trump administration who directs the energy and global warming program at the free-market Competitive Enterprise Institute. “This looks like a preparatory effort to get the National Assessment pointed in the right direction,” he said in an interview.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAndrew Rosenberg, a former NOAA official and director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Science and Democracy, described the papers as an effort to “seed the record for the National Climate Assessment and future legal action by circumventing the peer-review and consensus process.”“They want to get nonsensical, debunked pseudoscience into the ‘official’ government record without subjecting it to independent evaluation,” Rosenberg wrote in an email.Betsy Weatherhead, director of National Climate Assessment, said in a statement to The Washington Post that studies intended for the report should be thoroughly vetted.“Thoughts written down without process of peer review and lacking the multiple layers of scientific evaluation which goes into modern assessments are hardly worth reading when one wants trustworthy information,” she wrote.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementShe added, “The last National Climate Assessment involved hundreds of scientists and reviewers and concluded that climate change is happening, primarily caused by an increase in greenhouse gases and will likely continue.”Trump administration taps mainstream climate scientist to run key climate reviewThe unapproved papers were published on a website hosted by the Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences, which calls itself “a multidisciplinary and independent research group” but provides no information as to any individual or organization that supports it and solicits donations from visitors to the site. The group is affiliated with longtime climate contrarian Willie Soon.It appeals for contributions by declaring its independence “from industry, government, religion, politics or ideology,” despite posting the documents from Legates bearing the Executive Office of the President’s seal.As of Wednesday morning, CERES had removed the website containing the papers, but the page can be accessed on the internet archive.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe papers were written by well-known climate-change contrarians including William Happer, a professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University, who served a stint on the White House National Security Council in the Trump administration, and Ross McKitrick, an economics professor at the University of Guelph.Several of the authors who contributed to the effort either have received funding from the fossil fuel industry or are affiliated with anti-regulatory organizations, or both. Among them is Patrick Michaels, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, but it’s unclear where the funding for this series of papers came from.Legates is listed as the main author of the series, with other contributors including Maue, who was installed as NOAA chief scientist in September and before his detail at OSTP. Maue recognizes the reality of human-caused climate change but has spoken out repeatedly against what he views as overly alarmist findings or interpretations of climate science.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementRoy Spencer, who wrote a paper in the series titled “The Faith-Based Nature of Human-Caused Global Warming,” is a climate scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville who has long questioned the extent of the link between climate change and human activities. He posted the entire set of papers on his personal blog last week.“David [Legates] hopes to be able to get these posted on the White House website by January 20 (I presume so they will become a part of the outgoing Administration’s record) but there is no guarantee given recent events,” Spencer wrote. “He said we are free to disseminate them widely.”Spencer also wrote on his blog that Legates had asked him and other scientists to write these papers late last year to support the view that “there is no climate crisis or climate emergency” and to point out “the widespread misinformation being promoted by alarmists through the media.”On Tuesday, Spencer announced on his blog that he had taken down the post containing the papers, telling readers: “we have been told to remove links to the brochures, which is the prerogative of the OSTP Director since they have the White House seal on them.”Holdren, the former OSTP director, wrote that the papers’ appearance under the banner of the Executive Office of the President and the OSTP without authorization was “not merely outrageous but, apparently, illegal.”U.S. Code states: “Whoever fraudulently or wrongfully affixes or impresses the seal of any department or agency of the United States … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”The OSTP did not reply to a question regarding any disciplinary measures for Legates’s actions.This article, first published Monday night, was updated Tuesday with additional information from the OSTP and to add comments from John Holdren, former OSTP director, and Betsy Weatherhead, current director of the National Climate Assessment. It was updated Wednesday morning noting the papers were taking down from the contrarian websites where they were initially posted.",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightWith a week left in power, President Trump and his remaining allies aren’t going gently into the night. In Washington, new impeachment proceedings provoked by Trump’s efforts to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory add to a growing thicket of urgent legislation awaiting Trump’s successor once he takes office. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spent recent days planting political land mines for a Biden administration keen to change course on Trump’s foreign policy.On Saturday, Pompeo announced he was lifting formal restrictions on contacts between U.S. and Taiwanese officials, a sign of Washington’s deepening antipathy toward Beijing but also a curious policy decision for the Trump administration to take in its waning days in power. Successive U.S. administrations have carefully managed their ties with Taiwan, which the United States does not formally recognize because of its relationship with Beijing. In blowing up the status quo, the Trump administration may be forcing Biden into a more direct confrontation with China.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn Sunday, Pompeo confirmed that the State Department would designate Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization, much to the outrage of humanitarian organizations, which have warned of dire consequences for diplomatic efforts and aid operations in the war-ravaged country.On Monday, the Trump administration opted to classify Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, an aggressively ideological decision that further deteriorates relations with Havana and reverses the steps the Obama administration took in delisting Cuba in 2015 as part of a broader thaw.The Trump administration announced Jan. 11 that it was returning Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. (Reuters)And on Tuesday, Pompeo declared Iran the “home base” for terrorist group al-Qaeda in a speech and announced sanctions on a handful of al-Qaeda-linked figures living within Iran. Critics of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign fear that the possibility of military action against Iranian targets before Trump departs the White House is still on the table.These actions appear to have a clear purpose. One U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to Foreign Policy, characterized the moves as “fire sale diplomacy” — or what the magazine’s reporters described as “parting shots from the outgoing administration deliberately aimed at hampering the incoming administration’s foreign policy.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe incoming administration may be able to vacate or reverse some of these decisions. But it raises the stakes for Biden’s initial foreign policy efforts and sets the table for bitter political fights at home, with Republican opponents poised to cast Biden and his allies as weak or soft should they try to climb down from some of the maximalist positions taken by Trump and Pompeo.Observers questioned the utility of the Cuba and Houthi designations. “This is pure diplomatic vandalism,” said David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, in a statement. He added that the Houthi designation made the task for his organization’s staff in Yemen “all but impossible. … [The] cost of terrorism designations in the middle of complex conflicts and humanitarian crises can be measured in innocent lives lost.”Placing Cuba back on the state sponsor of terrorism list is more a sop to anti-communist hard-liners in Florida’s community of Cuban exiles than a reflection of anything the Cuban regime has done in recent years. “A U.S. economic embargo of Cuba already curbs Americans’ ability to do business with or visit the communist island,” my colleagues reported. “But the new terrorism label could hinder commercial deals with third countries Cuba relies on to import essential goods and turn off foreign investors in its all-important tourism industry.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There is no factual basis to re-list #Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terror,” tweeted Ricardo Herrero, executive director of the Cuba Study Group. “This is a malicious, last-ditch effort to handicap Biden’s foreign policy, and reward [Trump] supporters in Florida for sticking with Trump even after he incited terrorist attacks against the U.S. Congress.”The decision to list the Houthis as a terrorist organization could have the most devastating effects. The Houthis, a rebel faction with ties to Iran, still control the majority of Yemen after years of ruinous fighting with a U.S.-backed and Saudi-led coalition. Hunger and disease stalk the land and aid organizations have already faced significant funding shortfalls this year, hampering their efforts to deliver urgent food and medicines to the country.The Trump administration designated Yemen's Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organization on Jan. 10, a move that will take effect Jan. 19. (Reuters)The Houthi designation only makes things harder. “It would prevent numerous Western aid organizations, concerned about prosecution for perceived support of the armed group, from operating in Houthi-controlled areas, where most Yemenis live,” my colleagues reported. “It could also prompt retaliatory measures by the rebels against aid groups, further undermining efforts to assist millions of Yemenis.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The consequences will be felt acutely across a country also hit hard by extreme hunger, cholera and covid-19, as banks, businesses and humanitarian donors become unwilling or unable to take on the risk of operating in Yemen,” said Scott Paul, Oxfam’s humanitarian policy lead. “Every day these designations remain in place will compound the suffering of Yemen’s most vulnerable families.”Even Republicans in Congress, where there is bipartisan support for disentangling the United States from Yemen’s war, condemned Pompeo’s move.“Yemen imports 90 percent of its food,” said two top GOP lawmakers, James E. Risch (Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Michael McCaul (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a statement. “In light of near-famine conditions that have already existed in Yemen, this designation will have a devastating effect on Yemen’s food supply and other critical imports unless the executive branch acts now to issue the necessary licenses, waivers and appropriate guidance prior to designation.”For all his talk of bringing “swagger” and putting America first on the world stage, Pompeo leaves behind a legacy of bruising and overtly ideological policy and myriad outraged and exasperated U.S. allies. On Tuesday, the top U.S. diplomat also abruptly canceled his final trip abroad — a European swing through Belgium and, originally, a planned stop in Luxembourg as well — on the grounds that administration officials were now focusing on the presidential transition.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut it seemed that the decision had been made for him. Luxembourg’s foreign minister, whom Pompeo was scheduled to meet Thursday, recently described Trump as a “criminal” and “political pyromaniac” for inciting the events of last week. Pompeo was clearly radioactive and unwelcome. But he, too, still seems keen on setting fires.Read more:Israel’s vaccine success can’t hide a deeper divideThe need to reckon with Trump’s liesThe end of the road for American exceptionalism",

        "article": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — For decades, America's diplomatic dealings with Taiwan were governed by intricate and arcane rules designed to support a key Asian partner without provoking Beijing — and avoid war in the Taiwan Strait. Details of the U.S. strategy toward China, meanwhile, were shrouded in secrecy.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis week, those rules went out the window.With days left in office, the Trump administration has cast aside long-standing policies toward China and Taiwan, both raising expectations and setting new constraints for how the Biden administration will deal with its largest geopolitical competitor.On Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly lifted U.S. government rules prohibiting interactions between American and Taiwanese diplomats, a move that amounted to a symbolic but significant upgrade in the U.S. relationship with the democratic island, which China claims as its territory.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWithin days, U.S. diplomats from The Hague to Washington were publicizing meetings with their Taiwanese counterparts, incensing Beijing, while Kelly Craft, the ambassador to the United Nations, prepared to travel to Taipei as the third high-profile U.S. official to visit in just eight months.Taiwan frets over how a Biden administration would deal with ChinaCraft’s trip was scuttled last-minute as part of a State Department-wide travel freeze, but Trump officials aimed another shot at China, and the incoming Biden administration. Late Tuesday, national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien released the full text — with a few sections redacted — of the U.S. Asia strategy, a secret 10-page document that highlighted the expansion of China’s “illiberal spheres of influence” as the No. 1 challenge that must be countered, ahead of North Korea.By declassifying the document two decades ahead of schedule, O’Brien said he hoped “to communicate to American people and to our allies in Asia the enduring commitment of the United States to keeping the Indo-Pacific region free and open long into the future.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCritics say the moves, timed shortly before the handover, were designed to nettle Beijing one last time and force the Biden administration to make difficult, and potentially politically costly, decisions. They also came as Pompeo in recent days designated Cuba and the Iran-backed Houthi group in Yemen as sponsors of terrorism.“If the new administration explicitly embraces the change, they get volatility and a confrontational relationship with China, which is what the Trump team and Pompeo wanted,” said Evan Medeiros, a professor at Georgetown University and former senior director for Asia on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council. “If they reject it, they get a political problem and a problem with Taiwan. The whole issue of contacts will become a new metric in the U.S.-China-Taiwan relationship.”For four years, the Trump administration has made confronting China a key pillar of its foreign policy. As part of that effort, particularly in the past year, Pompeo and senior officials have spoken vigorously in defense of Taiwan, the most sensitive issue in U.S.-China relations.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementChinese leader Xi Jinping has demanded that Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen acknowledge the basic tenet that Taiwan and China are part of one China. The Chinese government objects strenuously to diplomatic exchanges and official visits that cast Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as a sovereign state.The Taipei government was expelled from the United Nations in 1971, after which many countries including the United States switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing, and Taipei today cannot participate in some U.N. functions, such as the World Health Organization’s discussions on the coronavirus pandemic, because of Chinese objections.Pompeo’s decision has revived debate in Washington and Taipei about whether and how the United States should aid Taiwan. Successive U.S. administrations routinely weigh questions both concrete and symbolic about Taiwan, including how to stage visits with Taiwanese officials and which advanced American weapons or fighter jets the island should be allowed to procure.China threatens invasion of Taiwan in new video showing military mightAs relations with Beijing soured sharply last year, the Trump administration lavished Taiwan with a series of high-profile official visits, while Pompeo’s weekend declaration removed another symbolic barrier to Taiwan’s claims of being recognized on the international stage.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMark Stokes, executive director of the Project 2049 Institute, applauded Pompeo’s move as a “positive legacy piece” at the end of an administration and said it could lead the Biden administration into a more sweeping rethink of U.S. policy toward Taiwan.Others criticized Pompeo for political grandstanding. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister who now heads the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the Trump officials could have spent more energy focusing on concrete steps to aid Taiwan, like pushing for its readmission into the WHO.“A formal declaration of this type does nothing materially to increase Taiwan’s international political space or enhance the security interests of the Taiwanese people, it arguably creates a greater sense of crisis in the Taiwan Strait,” Rudd said. “If Pompeo was serious about this, why not do this one or two years ago? This is an exercise in Republican primary politics.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTaiwanese officials, particularly from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which traditionally leaned toward declaring formal independence from China, have sought relaxation of the State Department rules governing contacts for more than a decade. Those appeals were significantly stepped up the last year or so, said two people with knowledge of the Tsai government’s thinking.Taiwanese officials reveled in Pompeo’s new decree. “Decades of discrimination, removed,” said the Taiwanese envoy in Washington, Bikhim Hsiao, on Twitter. “A huge day in our bilateral relationship. I will cherish every opportunity.”On China’s front line, emerging cold war haunts battle-worn Taiwanese islandsThe Taiwanese president, who is typically more cautious, did not comment on the shift.Story continues below advertisementIn China, where experts and state media have been bracing for an 11th-hour surprise from Trump officials, the foreign ministry promised “harsh punishment” for Pompeo breaking with decades of diplomatic tradition. Speculation has ramped up on social media this week that Pompeo could personally visit Taiwan as a final act.AdvertisementOn Monday, the Communist Party-controlled Global Times newspaper addressed the rumors in an editorial and warned that Chinese fighter jets would immediately be dispatched over Taiwan in the event Pompeo arrived. “If the U.S. and the island of Taiwan dare to overreact, war will be sparked,” the newspaper warned.Xiong Lili, the dean of international relations at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the lifting of diplomatic restrictions was a “final madness” that, if continued by Biden, would break the fragile balance of U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.Story continues below advertisement“It would mean that high-level political and military exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan are becoming normalized,” he said. “The consequences will be catastrophic.”China policy experts say Pompeo’s policy change, prudent or not, will revive fundamental questions about the U.S.-China relationship — a necessity given increased Chinese competition with the United States, Beijing’s expanding influence on the global stage and the Chinese Communist Party’s increasingly authoritarian actions at home and abroad.Advertisement“U.S.-Taiwan relations had almost a Kabuki theater element to it — so stylized and carefully managed,” said Margaret Lewis, a law professor at Seton Hall University. “There’s an intense sensitivity not just to the substance of those meetings but the optics. By having this shift, it does raise a lot of questions about how those interactions will be structured going forward.”\n\nTaiwan frets over how a Biden administration would deal with ChinaOn China’s front line, emerging cold war haunts battle-worn Taiwanese islandsChina threatens invasion of Taiwan in new video showing military might",

        "article": "Europe's top digital enforcer said Tuesday that she didn't understand why Twitter, Facebook and other social media networks had waited so long to bar President Trump from their platforms — but she also said that a broad proposal in Europe to rein in digital giants would give banned users the opportunity to appeal such decisions.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn an interview with The Washington Post, European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager expressed alarm about the attack last week on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters and said of the planned transition of power on Inauguration Day: “I really, really hope that it will go well.”For years, Trump’s Twitter account had gone unchecked as he broadcast a  torrent of falsehoods that culminated in an attempt by his backers to use violence to overturn the results of a democratic election. The drama in Washington since the storming of the Capitol has helped crystallize some of the competing forces that Vestager has long tried to address to curtail the power of big tech companies. E.U. leaders say the decisions about how to address those challenges should rest in the hands of societies, not unaccountable corporate leaders at Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere.These are the platforms that have banned Trump and his allies“It seems after all these years of Trumpism and all the fact-checking of his statements, then five minutes to 12, or one minute to 12, or 30 seconds to 12, to ban him, that seems a little bit, ‘Why haven’t you done more before?’ ” said Vestager, arguably the world’s most powerful enforcer of life in the digital world. “If you have a situation where someone is doing something that they shouldn’t do, you may take down their post, but you have to engage with them.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNonetheless, Vestager acknowledged, Trump’s incitement was extraordinary, and the situation may have called for extraordinary responses, as well.“This is, of course, the most extreme of extreme situations, that the president of the United States is inciting people to go toward Congress,” she said. “So I completely accept that this is an extreme situation, and lines have been crossed.”Buffeted by the Trump presidency and by their own domestic challenges with extremism, Vestager and other top E.U. officials last month proposed rules that would give governments more power to fight disinformation and to force big tech companies to police content that violates European laws. Companies would also need to make more public the algorithms that make decisions about what content to highlight.Story continues below advertisementThe proposals — a pair of bills named the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act — represent the most ambitious effort to regain regulatory control of the digital world since it became an essential part of modern life.E.U. proposes sweeping new rules for online business that could force fundamental changes for digital giantsBecause European societies are generally more accepting than the United States of governmental regulation, the European Union has in recent years policed the actions of tech giants far more aggressively than U.S. regulators. And because the bloc’s 450 million people constitute a vast and rich market, its decisions often reverberate far beyond European borders.AdvertisementThe new proposals, which are subject to discussion, could become law within about two years.Story continues below advertisement“The spread of lies, and the difficulties in discussing whether things are true or not, becomes increasingly difficult if our reality becomes privatized because public space is empty, and we are each in our own feed,” Vestager said.And though she said that the European Union was wary of regulating content, she expressed puzzlement about cultural differences between the United States and Europe over what was permissible online.“I'm from Denmark, and we have a quite liberal view when it comes, for instance, to nudity,” she said. “It’s just thought-provoking that you can blatantly lie about essentials in your democracy, but you cannot show a nipple.”Story continues below advertisementVestager’s views appeared to be more nuanced than some of her fellow European leaders, who have questioned Twitter’s move against Trump. Many Europeans have spent Trump’s term astounded by his tweets, but some policymakers are also cautious about the implications of the leaders of private corporations making unilateral decisions about what is acceptable speech from presidents and prime ministers.AdvertisementGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said through a spokesman Monday that decisions about the freedom of opinion should be made by laws, “not according to a decision by the management of social media platforms.”“From this angle, the chancellor considers it problematic that the accounts of the U.S. president have now been permanently blocked,” said Steffen Seibert, the spokesman.Story continues below advertisementFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire echoed that concern, telling France Inter radio Monday that “what shocks me is that it was Twitter that shut it down. The regulation of digital giants can’t and shouldn’t be done by the digital oligarchy itself.”E.U. antitrust regulators announce charges against Amazon, alleging unfair business practicesIn the interview with The Post, Vestager said that she hoped that the start of the Biden administration would be an opportunity to have a transatlantic discussion about the relationship between democratic societies and digital giants.AdvertisementEurope and the United States are also due for a discussion about relations with China and the role of Chinese companies in developing the digital world of the future.Story continues below advertisementThe Trump administration has led an aggressive campaign against the use of technology made by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei as the world builds next-generation 5G data networks. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to continue that effort, which has yielded mixed results in Europe even though policymakers increasingly consider the Chinese components a security threat. Two weeks ago, the European Union struck a trade deal with China despite U.S. reservations, adding to the transatlantic divisions.After Biden’s election victory in November, the European Commission proposed creating an E.U.-U.S. council to discuss digital issues, in the hope of sparking a more collaborative approach than in the contentious years under Trump.Advertisement“We see a lot of similarities in our approach when it comes to technology, when it comes to security, when it comes to open democracy,” Vestager said. “For us, the important thing is that we share some of the same aims, and then we can find ways of dealing with it, because the U.S. and the European Union are some of the world’s biggest democracies.”She added: “That ought to be the starting point for something also geopolitically good.”\nBirnbaum reported from Riga, Latvia.Trump scrambles to find new social network after Twitter ban, as White House prepares to blast big techAmazon suspends Parler, taking pro-Trump site offline indefinitelyPresident Trump lashes out at social media companies following Twitter ban",

        "article": "Congressional Democrats are moving to impeach President Trump and then go a step further: To ban him from running for office again. That penalty has never been imposed on an American president, but other countries have done it. From Peru to Brazil, from Italy to Israel, leaders who have been found guilty of wrongdoing have been suspended from electoral politics for years or even permanently.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightHow has that worked out?In some cases, the politicians’ careers have been damaged or ruined. In others, although the leaders were not allowed to run again, their allies and political movements have survived and even flourished.In Peru, for example, lawmakers in 2001 barred President Alberto Fujimori from holding office for a decade, following his ouster in a corruption scandal. But his daughter Keiko, boosted by his supporters, nearly won the presidency in 2011 and 2016. Argentine President Juan Perón was overthrown in a coup in 1955 and banned from running again. He not only returned to the country’s highest office in 1973, but his movement became a mainstay of Argentine politics — current President Alberto Fernández is a Peronista.A siege on the U.S. Capitol, a strike against democracy worldwideIn some instances in Latin America, Harvard political scientist Steven Levitzky said, imposing “legitimate bans on major populist figures for anti-democratic behavior didn’t work well. They were very destabilizing.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat is because those leaders portrayed themselves as martyrs and maintained a significant level of popularity, said Levitzky, co-author of “How Democracies Die.” Many people supported the politicians, but were unable to vote for them.And yet, allowing leaders who commit abuses to run again is also problematic, Levitzky said. He said Trump’s efforts to overturn presidential election results amounted to “stabbing at the heart of democracy.”“If he’s allowed to run, the system has to essentially condone his behavior,” Levitzky said. (Trump has called the impeachment effort “a witch hunt.”)Here are some world leaders who have been banned from returning to office, and the fallout:Fernando Collor de Mello, president of Brazil 1990-92Two years into his presidency, Collor de Mello was impeached on corruption charges and barred from running for office for eight years. But his political career was not over: He was elected to the Senate in 2006, and reelected in 2014. Another Brazilian ex-president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was leading in the polls for another term in 2018 when he was banned by an electoral court because he had been found guilty of corruption. That cleared the way for the election of former fringe politician Jair Bolsonaro. Lula is appealing his convictions and remains one of Brazil’s most popular politicians.Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru 1990-2000Lawmakers declared the conservative populist “morally unfit” amid a corruption scandal and removed him from the presidency in 2000. He was subsequently banned from public office. His daughter Keiko took up his political mantle — called Fujimorismo — benefiting from the support her father retained among poor Peruvians. She rose to lead the right-wing Popular Force party in Congress and finished second in the presidential races in 2011 and 2016. Alberto Fujimori is serving a 25-year prison sentence for corruption and human rights violations. Keiko Fujimori is under investigation for alleged money laundering — she says she is innocent — but could compete in April’s presidential election.Efraín Ríos Montt, president of Guatemala 1982-83The general took power in a 1982 coup and was deposed by the military a year later. A 1985 constitutional reform banned former coup leaders and their close relatives from running for president. Still, the ex-dictator ran for president in 2003, arguing that the provision did not apply to him. He won just 11 percent of the vote, but went on to serve in Congress from 2004 to 2012. In 2013, after losing his congressional seat and therefore his immunity from prosecution, he was convicted of genocide for the brutal massacre of Mayan citizens during the country’s civil war. The sentence was overturned, and he was being tried again when he died in 2018. Ríos Montt’s daughter Zury was a leading far-right presidential candidate in 2019 but was disqualified under the constitutional ban.Ehud Olmert, prime minister of Israel 2006-09After leaving office, Olmert was convicted of bribery, fraud, obstruction of justice and breach of trust, and served 16 months in prison. Israeli law bans people convicted of crimes of “moral turpitude” from running for the Knesset for seven years from their release from prison. After Olmert completed his sentence in 2017, he sought to clear his name. Though his reputation was tarnished, Olmert did not lose followers as such because, the Israeli parliamentary system revolves more around parties than individual leaders.Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister of Italy 1994-95, 2001-06, 2008-11The media mogul and center-right politician served as Italy’s prime minister for more than nine years between 1994 and 2011. In 2013, he was convicted of tax fraud; he subsequently was expelled from the Senate and banned from holding political office for six years. He remained influential through his media holdings and his leadership of the Forza Italia party. An Italian court lifted the political ban in 2018, a year early, citing “good conduct.” While Berlusconi’s party has declined in popularity, he won a seat in the European Parliament in 2019.\nThe world’s populists are losing their White House ally, but global Trumpism is far from overWorld leaders express shock after storming of the U.S. CapitolAs Mexico’s security deteriorates, the power of the military grows",
